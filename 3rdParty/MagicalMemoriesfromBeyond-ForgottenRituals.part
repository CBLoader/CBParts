    <Flavor> You have delimited a perimeter in the sand of the beach, knowing well that its main constituent, that is to say silica, was the basic element required by the ritual, followed by natron and lime, which you've added up. Then you've brought a flame. The heat has intensified tenfold, hundredfold, fueled by the ritual's magic, and the glass objects you have visualized in your mind have slowly emerged from this rudimentary matrix. </Flavor>

From an ample mixture containing all the ingredients required in glass-making - or else from a sufficient quantity or recycled glass - combined with an intense magical heat you create permanent objects made of translucent or transparent glass, just like a glassblower or glass-maker would. The dimension of the objects - as well as the number created - are determined by the Arcana or Nature check result and they can be anything you want, ranging from the simplest bottles to the most awesome objects d'art. The performer knows if he has reached the desired size before the ritual's completion and can elect to abort the process if he wishes so or select more modest objects instead. Stopping midstream means that no components are expended; salvaging them could prove to be quite problematic however, the secondary ingredients being mixed up with the sand as part of the ritual. On the other hand, by recycling the matrix the caster can elect to start the process anew with the same medium over and over again until he has obtained the right result, which undeniably cost less but can prove excessively time consuming. 
The glass can be colored if the performer of the ritual wishes so by adding a metal oxide (or else) according to the desired hue he wants, though this operation doubles the ritual's cost (same holds true for the market price). The ritual has limitations however; only monochrome objects can be realized, though many shades of the same color can adorn the items simultaneously. Patterns, such as spirals, strips, or waves can improve the appearance of the items as desired, but it is absolutely impossible to create objects that require enameling or that are engraved. On the other hand, the products thus obtained can be enhanced later on with the right techniques.

Although this ritual has not been originally conceived as a defensive means many spellcasters who have experimented with it have discovered that any creature that crosses the zone where the glass objects are forming suffer 1d6 fire damage for each round they spend within the area, which renders this ritual useful to impede movements in a given zone for a very long period of time.

This simple ritual creates a given number of small receptacles, such as coins or crystal pieces, which sole purpose is to double the duration of a Light when this cantrip is cast upon one, although a given receptacle can receive only a limited number of such cantrips before being utterly exhausted, the number of enhanced Light being fixed at the completion of the ritual. The other advantage is that even if a second Light or more are cast, all those previously placed upon such receptacles remain active nonetheless - contrary to what happens when you normally use this cantrip - winking out only when a 10 minutes period have been reached.

The Arcana check result made during the ritual determines how many receptacles are created and the number of Light they can receive before they become inert.

Like its namesake indicates this ritual provides the recipient with a total of six arms but moreover with powers being generally the sole preserve of the she-serpentine demons. The Arcana or Religion check determines for how long the arms and the abilities last and also specifies the number of powers granted, which are chosen by the recipient among the list below; since these powers are those of a marilith see the D&amp;D 4E MONSTER MANUAL to know how they work. Of course, all the attacks delivered via these powers use the character's own abilities scores.

* Hacking Blades
* Resist 20 variable
* Shroud of Steel
* The Abyssal Lady (special). This incomparable power can be selected only by a woman coming from one of the following races: dwarf, eladrin, elf, half-elf, or human. The Abyssal Lady enables a female of the aforementioned races to turn her legs into a serpentine tail, and to use either the speed of a marilith of her own speed, whichever is best. The recipient gains darkvision and is automatically proficient with scimitars even if she wasn't before. Moreover, The Abyssal Lady is considered as a Large creature and has Reach 2 for her attacks. Note that accessing this power requires one more healing surge.
* Weapon Dance

The character reverts to her normal self either at the end of the time period or as soon as she has participated in as many encounters as stipulated in parentheses, whichever comes first.

The ritual's components include six scimitars. At least one of these curved blades must be silvered and another ought to be magical. The ritual randomly consumes as many blades as the recipient gains powers.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana or Religion Check Result	Duration	Number of Powers

This ritual creates a ghostly, dwarf-like humanoid, which can dig a hole, remove gravel, or tunnel a way out through earth and rock alike as required, though it does so only if you give it specific instructions and if you moreover provide the mining implements required for the job, such as a spade or a shovel. The phantasmal miner cannot fight on your behalf nor interact with other creatures, being limited to labor-intensive jobs. The Arcana or Religion check fix the duration of service of the ghostlike worker as well as the amount of matter it can remove. If a cave in, landslide, or suchlike event ever occurs while the entity works the phantom is unaffected and simply comes back to receive new instructions, though it most likely needs new tools in order to resume the task. Finally, the phantasmal miner cannot travel at more than 20 squares away from the spot where it first appeared.

Thieves and adventurers who want to gain access to a building by way of a window sometimes employ this ritual, though more often than not they simply sacrifice a slab of glass in order to gain a form of concealment and some protection. A snowflake is engraved over the windowpane with a diamond-tipped tool before the glass is smashed. This operation is soundless thanks to the magic imbued into the pane from the very beginning; moreover, the shards remain in suspension around a single character designed during the ritual thereafter, forming an ever moving cloud that provides concealment just like a heavy falling snow would (for more details about Concealment consult the D&amp;D 4E PLAYER'S HANDBOOK). This screen of glass particles is not very discreet however, reflecting any light sources, thus it often attracts unwanted attention (increase the DC of any Stealth checks by 5 when any light is present).

The swirling cloud occupies a space around the recipient that is equivalent to a close burst 1. Anyone who tries to enter this space or remains inside the area is mercilessly buffeted by the cutting shards, suffering 1d4 damage each round, and is blinded (save ends). The cloud is soon used up in such a situation however, delivering damage only for a total of 5 rounds or less (this aspect depending upon the Arcana check); the cloud moreover loses its potency if flings as a blast thereafter (see below), dealing 1d4 damage less for each round where it has been previously worn out and losing special effects accordingly.

The cloud of broken glass can be hurled at anytime against foes in the form of a blast. The use of this power is a standard action that targets each creature in the blast. The attack uses the recipient's Intelligence against the target(s) Reflex. The area of effect of the blast and the amount of damage dealt are both determined by the Arcana check along with special effects if any.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Area of Effect	Damage	Special Effects
9 or lower	Blast 1	1d4	None
10-14	Blast 2	2d4	Hit: Target is pushed 1 square Miss: Half damage only
15-19	Blast 3	3d4	Hit: Target is pushed 1 square and is blinded (save ends) Miss: Half damage only
20-24	Blast 4	4d4	Hit: Target is pushed 2 squares and is blinded (save ends) Miss: Half damage only
25-29	Blast 5	5d4	Hit: Target is pushed 2 squares, knocked prone, and is blinded (save ends) Miss: Half damage only
30 or higher	Blast5	20	Hit: Target is unconscious Miss: Half damage only&lt;/table&gt;

This ritual brings into existence the spirit of a non-described scribe that is capable to read aloud a tome or transcript a text designed by you while simultaneously doing the translation of the work, being moreover able to switch from one language to another as required. The number of languages known by the phantasmal scribe thus conjured depends upon the Arcana or Religion check result, but the caster is the one who determines which languages the translator effectively knows (see the list below). Implements such as ink, quills, parchments, or blank books must be provided to the spirit, which can then reproduce faithfully any tome down to the minute details, including annotations in margin, drawings, illuminations and plans if any are present. The spirit can tirelessly copy or translate the entire content of a page in six minutes regardless the nature of the work therein, including rituals and spells. If a scribe has finished a specific job and that the duration of its service is not over yet it can be assigned a new task, else it simply remains still.

If the volume upon which the phantom scribe works ever contains a Secret Page or more (see this ritual in the D&amp;D 4E PLAYER'S HANDBOOK) the scrivener is entitled to a Perception check to notice the hidden passages, using the passive Perception of the ritual's performer in order to do so. You can order the scribe to specifically look for all the Secret Pages contained within the pages of a given book, but in that case half its' time is devoted to that task, which results in fewer pages transcribed. Moreover, the scrivener does the copy of the false pages and that of the real ones as well when it discovers a Secret Page, leaving the elucidation of such passages to the reader.

This ritual empowers a single ranged weapon (any weapon that possesses a range qualify, regardless the name of the ritual) or a single projectile fired from a ranged weapon with the capability to remain in temporal stasis until a given condition has been fulfilled, a short command being formulated to set the moment of its release while the weapon is static. This order must be concise and expressed in less than 15 words else the ritual fails. If an event occurs before the instruction has been entirely worded, like the apparition of an unexpected enemy in front of the missile, the projectile remains fixed in place and can still be commanded as the situation required (a free action); once completed the instructions cannot be altered however.

The attack is conducted like a normal ranged attack and uses the attack roll of the character that has launched the missile. A character capable to fire more than once in a round, like a ranger using the Twin Strike exploit for example, or someone who has more than one round to get ready, can effectively release many missiles prepared with this ritual if enough are available; note that when a power is employed the ritual must abide to the letter of that power regarding the target(s) entry. Thus, a ranger attacking with the Twin Strike exploit can target either one or two creatures, but not so if she strikes with the Two-Fanged Strike exploit, the late one stipulating under target only one creature. Also, an elf that has rolled poorly when he has fired one of these special shots can resort to Elven Accuracy and make use of the second roll.

This ritual is sometimes used as trap, though the wording of the command must be explicit enough in that case; many characters who utilize the ritual as such often state something akin to "Strike anyone and anything but me who approaches this zone." If a projectile ever remains in stasis because the directive was too vague - or ironically, because someone arrives opposite the direction the missile points at - it can simply be plucked by anyone who can reach it and employed like a normal object; however the temporal stasis that holds the thing in the air doesn't prevent its deterioration, and a weapon that stays immobile for years can show significant traces of decay.

This ritual allows you to witness first hand a specific event from the past that has obligatory taken place in front of a given reflective plane - a mirror, window, or any surface that generates a perceptible reflection - just like if you were tapping into some virtual memory the object had possessed. You can see and hear in the mirror's depths a conform re-enactment of what has transpired from the surface's point(s) of view. Thus, if the place was in total darkness, therefore no images are conveyed, although sounds might still be perceptible if there were any. If the surface wasn't clean at the time of the event than the play can be seen through a hazy veil, and so on. It is also possible that the action didn't take place exactly in front of the reflective surface but somewhere else in the whole picture the mirror has "memorized"; an observer can always move left or right while the performance unfolds and gains new perspectives regarding the area and the drama - many spectators acting in concert can even gain more information by occupying many positions at once.

The moment in time you want to observe must be worded as precisely as you can; if the description is not precise enough the ritual fails, though the components aren't expended in that case. Same holds true if the object hadn't seen the event about which you referred to.

This ritual doesn't provide the participants with darkvision, nor with any other special powers for that matter; anyone who witnesses the chain of events can use Perception checks to sort out details however.

Magical wards in place in the mirror's vicinity at the time of the event - like the Forbiddance ritual - are now completely irrelevant and cannot prevent this temporal intrusion.

Your Arcana check result determines how far in the past you can go back and for how long you can observe the episode that takes place at the designated moment in time you decided on. If the looking-glass from which you recall the experience is still occupying the same ground as it did at the time of the incident you gain a +5 modifier to your Arcana check.

    <Flavor> The pair of guards looked sidelong at the motley she-harlequin coming their way, the lady hopping joyously and humming a merry tune all the while. "Seems we're going to enjoy this festival a little bit after all" said the first suggestively. The second only smiled, but his grin didn't hold for long as the fire nearby was snuffed all the sudden. Then, the lady-jester was upon him, pummeling him senseless with the thin metallic scepter she held firmly in her hand. </Flavor>

Originally conceived as toys for many kings and emperors, these already sophisticated, fully-articulated mannequins were soon enhanced further and turned into superb automatons, endowed with intelligence, physical skills, combat capabilities, and simple magical abilities. In fact a wild jester is capable to cast only cantrips, these late ones being incorporated in its "mind" during the ritual, their total number being determined by the Arcana check. Possible cantrips include - but are not limited to - the following ones: Ghost Sound, Light, Mage Hand, and Prestidigitation.

The harlequin or jester suit, though not obligatory, often remains the trademark of these constructs along with various masks, which conceal their true nature. A wild jester is linked to its proprietor thanks to an identical set of scepters known as baubles or marottes, each individual obligatory holding one. The rods are deceptively fragile in appearance, but can effectively serve as weapons. If ever disarmed, a wild jester carries on the last order it has received to the best of its abilities. Taking away the proprietor's rod for more than 24 hours has the same effect, an individual requiring an entire day to attune itself to the construct if he ever wants to control it. A wild jester that is no longer directed becomes a free-thinking individual when more than an entire day has passed and can no longer be controlled in this fashion ever again.

Marotte: A marotte, or bauble, is a prop stick or sceptre with a carved head that is typically carried by a fool, harlequin, or jester. In this particular case it's a light mace made from the finest and most resilient steel, which is deceptively fragile-looking. The marotte can be used as an off-hand weapon.
