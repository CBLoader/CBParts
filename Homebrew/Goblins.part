    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> You carry with you your namesake weapon, sootblackened so that it's gleam might be as hidden as yourself, moments before you spring on an unsuspecting foe to stain it crimson.
Of all goblins you most embody the soft-footed nature of your kind, going unseen and unheard when it is called for. For this reason you often take up the mantle of scout, or the front-line warrior as part of an ambush. In each role your talent is honed to see and take advantage of each slip up and opening presented by the opposition. </specific>
    <specific name="Benefit"> Features
-Stealthy: You gain the stealth skill as a class skill. If your selected class already has it listed you gain +2 bonus to that skill.
-Combat Advantage: Deals 1d6 extra damage against any target it has combat advantage against.
-Sneaky: When shifting you can move into a space occupied by an ally. The ally shifts into your previous space as a free action. </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Small and weak, goblins aren't much in a straight up fight and thus cleverly rarely get involved in them. Bloodthorns like the blackblades adhere to this principle, but instead of opting for going unseen they prefer to go untouched. Moving quickly about they evade their foes as they harry them with missile fire from position of great advantage.
Even if their foes can manage to close, they deftly dive back from any blow before moving aside while delivering one more thorn into their foes side. </specific>
