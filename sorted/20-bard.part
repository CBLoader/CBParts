Bards are artists first and foremost, and they practice magic just as they practice song, drama, or poetry. They have a clear sense of how people perceive reality, so they master charm magic and some illusions. Sagas of great heroes are part of a bard's repertoire, and most bards follow the example of many fables and become skilled in a variety of fields. A bard's artistic ability, knowledge of lore, and arcane might are widely respected, particularly among the world's rulers.
Art and magic share a sublime beauty, and, as a bard, you seek the place where the two meet. You might be a naturally talented wanderer who casts impressive spells almost instinctively, a student of a bardic college who learned ordered systems of magic and epic poetry, a warrior skald who mixes skill at arms with thundering music, a dashing performer known for putting on a good show even for your enemies, or a perfectionist who seeks the consummate formula that blends art and magic into a higher force.
A steady rhythm beats in the back of your mind as you brandish your sword. Your eyes and ears pick up the motion of the villains that surround you, and one glance tells you everything you need to know to defeat them. You whistle three staccato notes, letting your allies know the symphony of battle is about to begin.

Those who live on the fringes of civilization, or who come from places where civilization is nothing like what the mortal races understand, rely on chroniclers and historians who maintain their history as oral tradition. These individuals, respected for their knowledge and insights, serve as the keepers of the heritage of their people. It is their responsibility to make sure that none forget the past. They are both observers and storytellers; what they see becomes the legends and tales passed on from one generation to the next. These historians are known as skalds.
	A skald is no mere entertainer. Skalds are responsible for witnessing firsthand the great events of their time, committing those events to memory, and then passing on those tales. They learned all the tales of the previous generation as well, and theirs is a line of storytellers who pass on the entire history of their people. Skalds travel from one place to the next, acting as witnesses to the events of their time. Along the way they pick up new stories and bits of magic and other tricks that add to their mystique.
	Among the people of the world and other realms who know of this bardic tradition, skalds are nearly sacred. They can move freely through enemy territory and are considered untouchable even during the most bitter of tribal feuds. In many ways, skalds are like holy leaders: All but the most honorless thugs hesitate to attack them, and they are revered  and respected for their role as masters of history. When a culture's entire history is contained within the tales told by a single person, that person is more than just a storyteller; he or she is the sum total of that history, and that of all its ancestors, given flesh.
	In the Feywild, a skald is treated as a visiting dignitary, no matter where he or she comes from. From Cendriane to Mithrendain, even the most unmannered and barbaric skalds can find food, shelter, and respect throughout the lands of the eladrin. The Summer Queen herself would not refuse an audience with a skald, though most skalds know better than to bother powerful fey lords and ladies with trifling matters in such sessions. The status of a skald is perhaps even more elevated in the Feywild than it is in the mortal world, so that few in the  fey realm would risk being savaged in the stories of a skald, their names blackened for the rest of history because of an offense they committed against a storyteller.

Luck and fate are two concepts that find their way into almost every song and tale about the Feywild, for the fey races seem to be masters at bending chance to their will. Bards who sing about these events often find that their allies are suddenly overcome by a streak of good luck themselves. Some believe that it is enough to sing of the fey in order to steal their luck, but most bards believe it is simply the ally making his or her own good fortune.

Like fey creatures themselves, fey magic is often described as nimble by its admirers, or slippery by those who have been on the receiving end of it. You've learned to quickly interpose a spell between your allies and certain death, intervening in the nick of time.

The magic used to create a greater chilled blade spell, as well as its lesser versions, is said to draw power from the Prince of Frost's domain. When you cast this spell, you widen that connection, allowing through it a cold infused with the arcane power of the Feywild, a cold so deep that it can make living flesh brittle.

Some songs are so filled with depressing imagery that the listener
cannot help becoming despondent upon hearing it. It is said that master bards have passed on the knowledge of the song sung by the Raven Queen to the dying, and they can use that song to literally exhaust their enemies with sorrow.

    <Category> ID_INTERNAL_CATEGORY_UNKNOWN,ID_INTERNAL_INTERNAL_SIGNS_OF_INFLUENCE,1 </Category>
    <Flavor> All bards wield some influence no matter where they go among civilized peoples. Even in hostile cities, you might be regarded with respect, however grudging. The Signs of Influence optional class feature represents the extent of a bard's influence in the world. 
	If you and your DM agree, your bard gains access to certain qualities known as signs of influence. Each sign of influence provides an ability that the bard can use to gain some benefit in a civilized area. Most signs of influence provide benefits of little monetary value, but they can be a great boon or relief when a bard leads a bedraggled group of adventurers back into civilization after a harrowing adventure. </Flavor>
    <specific name="Short Description"> Gain two Signs of Influence options at 1st level and additional options at 13th and 17th levels </specific>

  <RulesElement name="Attract Attendants" type="Class Feature" internal-id="ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4140" source="Heroes of the Feywild">
    <Flavor> In any civilized area that reveres bards, there are always those who are eager to please, hoping to have themselves represented in the bard's tales. These seekers offer their services to the bard for a short while, allowing the bard to focus on important business while the attendants take care of menial tasks. </Flavor>
    <specific name="Short Description"> Receive up to 3 servants when in communities that revere bards </specific>
    <specific name="Level"> 1 </specific>
Whenever you are in a village, town, or other civilized location that reveres bards, up to three servants will attend to your needs while in that location. These servants run errands for you, help you with physical tasks (such as moving chests of treasure or cleaning), and carry out any mundane task that a servant could reasonably be asked to perform.
</RulesElement>
  <RulesElement name="Demand Audience" type="Class Feature" internal-id="ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4141" source="Heroes of the Feywild">
    <Flavor> Refusing an audience with a bard is tantamount to writing yourself into history as a villain of one sort or another. Bards can often gain entry into places that others would be turned away from, and even the most powerful rulers know better than to refuse a bard who requests a meeting. </Flavor>
    <specific name="Short Description"> Receive an audience with ruling power of a community that reveres bards within 24 hours </specific>
    <specific name="Level"> 1 </specific>
Whenever you are in a village, town, or city that reveres bards, you can receive an audience with someone representing the ruling power within 24 hours, and you are guaranteed safe passage to that audience by the local authorities. You can use this ability no more than once a month in a particular settlement.

  <RulesElement name="Ritual Beneficiary" type="Class Feature" internal-id="ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4142" source="Heroes of the Feywild">
    <Flavor> Though the bard is a master of many talents, sometimes you might have to call on someone who has greater knowledge in a certain field, especially in matters related to magic. When you have need of magical expertise, sages and magic users that respect your calling are eager to provide you with their services. </Flavor>
    <specific name="Short Description"> Once per day you can have a ritual with component cost of 150 gp or less cast for free while in a community with a non-hostile ritual caster (cannot create permanent items) </specific>
    <specific name="Level"> 1 </specific>
Whenever you are in a village, a town, or some other civilized location where a person lives who is capable of casting rituals, once per day you can have any ritual cast for free if it normally has a component cost of 150 gp or lower, provided that the ritual caster is not hostile toward you. The ritual cannot be one that produces a permanent item.
</RulesElement>
  <RulesElement name="Travel in Style" type="Class Feature" internal-id="ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4143" source="Heroes of the Feywild">
    <Flavor> Bards spend a lot of time on the road. They like to travel with a bit of style when possible, or at least with speed and comfort. Many consider it an honor to give or loan one's horses to a bard, and many a good word has been included in a bard's tale for a kindly stable master. </Flavor>
    <specific name="Short Description"> Borrow up to 8 horses and a cart or carriage from a community; you cannot use this power again until they are returned or paid for </specific>
    <specific name="Level"> 1 </specific>
Whenever you are in a village, town, or other civilized location where horses, carts, and carriages can be obtained and where bards are revered, you can procure horses for you and up to seven of your allies, plus a single cart or carriage at no cost, from someone in that location. Before you can use this ability again, you must return the horses and cart or carriage, leave them at a predetermined location, or pay for them.
	At the DM's discretion, you can obtain other modes of transportation of a similar value when available. For example, when visiting Cendriane, you might be able to obtain griffons to carry you to the city of Mithrendain, provided that the eladrin valued the use of griffons similar to that of horses and carts in the mortal world.

  <RulesElement name="Welcome Guest" type="Class Feature" internal-id="ID_FMP_CLASS_FEATURE_4144" source="Heroes of the Feywild">
    <Flavor> Having a bard stay under one's roof is a great honor indeed. Innkeepers often compete vigorously for the opportunity to offer shelter and food to visiting bards, and the winner brags about having such a guest for weeks or months to come. </Flavor>
    <specific name="Short Description"> Obtain room and board for yourself and up to 7 allies at inns where bards are revered </specific>
    <specific name="Level"> 1 </specific>
Whenever you are in a village, a town, or a city that has a public inn where bards are revered, you can use your influence (and perhaps the promise of a performance) to obtain meals and a comfortable room for you and up to seven of your allies for the duration of your stay in that location.

Over the centuries, many folktales and stories have been passed down in Erelhei-Cinlu. One tells of the zombie king, a dreadful monster that lies in stasis somewhere near the Vault. The location of his resting place is unknown, but stories say that at some secret time, he will be unleashed upon the city. Behind him will be an immense sea of the dead—souls claimed in the many wars the city has endured. Recounting this tale unnerves all who hear it.
