Constant pressure causes the Far Realm's corrupting influence to leak through even the smallest breaches into the natural world, spawning horrors that tear at the fabric of existence. These breaches represent some of the greatest dangers to the mortal realm, and generations of heroes have dedicated themselves to maintaining the integrity of the Far Realm's boundaries. Over a lifetime's adventuring, however, you have grown weary of this ultimately doomed effort.	For each fissure that is closed, two more open elsewhere. Worse, how many of the fault lines riddling creation remain undetected? The Far Realm relentlessly seeks to corrupt the mortal realm, but whereas most heroes seek only to defend against the Outside's malign influence, you have a better idea. You will turn the tide on the Far Realm by assaulting its borders, its creatures, its very nature. And if you cannot reshape the Far Realm with the benign influence of the natural world, you will destroy it utterly to eliminate the threat it represents.

The divine fragment you carry enables Bahamut to be reborn into the world, to live even if his divine form is slain, as unlikely an event as that might be. If your patron neverfaces destruction, good and constant service undoubtedly rewards you with a place in your god's dominion, perhaps as an exarch, perhaps as something more. Indeed, Bahamut keeps council with the greatest champions to have ever served him, and these allies attend him in all things. 
Bahamut is Dead, Long Live Bahamut: While all gods are immortal, no being is truly unkillable. Should Bahamut die, omens and visions reveal your final quest. Your purpose, to return Bahamut to the world, is made clear. You may carry the divine embryo, but you must take bold steps to allow the godling within to awaken and resume its proper place. When you fulfill every condition, divine fire consumes your very existence to restore the god to corporeal form. The sacrifice required is absolute, its destruction required to facilitate the rebirth. Though you no longer exist, your memory lives on within the god and those who follow him, granting you a rare form of immortality—within the fondest memories of a god. </specific>

Having long championed Bahamut in the world, taking up his causes and making them your own, you garner the god's attention. Seeing in you a reflection of his own noble character, he bestows on you a portion of his divine essence, both to make you a more effective servant and to protect a portion of his divinity against some future calamity. Great power accompanies this grave responsibility, power you can use to resemble your patron and access his own divine qualities.
The holy burden in no way restricts your personal objectives and you are free to pursue your own ends, though your goals likely coincide with those of the Platinum Dragon. You must have special care, however, for the fate of a god—and perhaps more—rests within your imperfect shell. From time to time, Bahamut might call upon you for a special task, to go places where he is unable, and act on his behalf, giving you a look into a possible future where you might serve as his exarch.

You have forged relationships with vestiges—the remnants of powerful forces and entities that once exercised great authority or demonstrated awful capabilities. These remnants are diverse in their backgrounds and motives. As a vestige pact warlock, you can choose from between two or more vestige pacts to fuel your arcane power.
Eyes of the Vestige: You know the eyes of the vestige spell. You gain an additional effect, referred to as an eyes of the vestige augment, associated with your active vestige (see below) when you make a successful attack with this power.
Pact Boon: You have a pact boon associated with your active vestige.
When an enemy under your Warlock's Curse drops to 0 hit points or fewer, you gain the benefit of your active vestige's pact boon.
Using Vestiges
You always have one active vestige. As a beginning character, you have access to the two primary vestiges: King Elidyr and Zutwa. You select one of these as your active vestige after a short rest or an extended rest.
Changing Your Vestige: You can gain temporary access to other vestiges by using certain daily attack powers. (For ease of identification, all these powers have names that begin with “Vestige.”) When you use a power that gives you access to a daily power vestige, you can choose for that vestige to immediately become your active vestige. If you do so, it remains your active vestige until you gain access to a different vestige by using another daily attack power or until the end of the encounter. If you don't immediately choose to change to that daily power vestige, your access to that vestige is lost until the next time you use that power.
After a short rest or an extended rest, you again select one of the two primary vestiges to be your active vestige. That vestige remains active until you change to a daily power vestige or until you take another short rest or extended rest.
In addition, certain benefits allow you to change your vestige at a different time or under different circumstances (See Vestige Pact Boons

Simple one-handed melee weapon
Cost: 5 gp
Damage: 1d6
Proficient: +2
Range: -
Weight: 1 lb.
These gauntlets are specially fitted with metal spikes. Unlike other weapons, the spiked gauntlet occupies your magic item hands slot while enchanted.
Properties: 
Off-Hand (An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can&apos;t attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.).
Group: 
Unarmed (When you punch, kick, elbow, knee, or even head butt an opponent, you&apos;re making an unarmed strike. A simple unarmed attack is treated as an improvised weapon. Creatures that have natural weapons such as claws or bite attacks are proficient with those natural weapons.). </specific>
