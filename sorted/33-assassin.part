The teachings of the Black Flame Zealot take a different approach: Rather than seeking to restrain the infusion of shadow, they instead feed it raw fury and hatred, stoking it as they would a bonfire. These assassins eschew the subtlety of shade form, favoring the destructive potential of black flame form instead.
You can gain the black flame form power instead of the shade form power. This new power emphasizes damage dealing, whereas shade form (and the feats and features related to it) emphasizes damage mitigation and stealthiness.

Assassins embrace shadow magic and pledge a shard of their souls to the Shadowfell to gain their power. By replacing a fundamental part of themselves with a dark reflection, they can manifest that piece of shadow to accomplish incredible things. The infusion of shadow magic allows assassins to identify weak points in an opponent&apos;s defenses so that with a few moments of study they can reduce the stoutest enemies to corpses.
	An assassin usually keeps his or her profession a secret, since few trust those who regularly deal in death. Assassins&apos;s guilds provide some measure of protection, especially in those regions where the study of shadow magic and assassination as an art form are banned.
	As an assassin, you are an outcast. You traded away a part of your soul for the power of death, and only the most-loyal companions accept your skills into their midst. Whatever drew you onto the assassin&apos;s path, you become a trained killer from whom few can escape unharmed.

    <Flavor> The heart of the executioner&apos;s ability to take down a foe is the assassin&apos;s strike technique. An executioner often has only one chance to eliminate an enemy. Once the element of surprise is lost, bodyguards (or even targets themselves, if capable) can interfere with the mission, leaving the target regretfully alive. This powerful technique represents the intersection of the assassin&apos;s knowledge of vital areas of the body, extreme mastery of weapons, and ability to throw everything he has into a single formidable attack. The executioner must wait for the exact right moment to strike, but when he does, this attack can slay a target instantly. </Flavor>

    <Flavor> Executioners have a long history with poison. All become masters at mixing their own poisons. For most assassins, poison is only one of their many weapons. Most of the poisons used by executioners are merely the set-up for a later attack, a precursor to ensure that the target won&apos;st be able to stop the executioner once the assassination attempt begins in earnest.
	Many poisons are outlawed in civilized realms, so executioners learn to craft simple, unstable venoms that quickly break down into inert components. In this manner, an assassin can travel with a seemingly innocent array of materials. When it is time to strike, the executioner quickly crafts a poison as needed. Because the poison is unstable, it decays rapidly and leaves no incriminating evidence if unused. A shrewd executioner can maintain an innocent facade even in the face of a thorough search of his or her person and quarters. </Flavor>

Executioners who reach the paragon tier have proven themselves more than capable of carrying out assassinations (both clandestine and public) without being caught or killed themselves. For you, simple political assassinations and hired killings begin to lose their luster, because city watchmen or the bodyguards of local merchants rarely challenge your skills.

Carrion crawler brain juice is exactly what its name claims: a poison derived from the brains of vicious carrion crawlers, which makes it a difficult substance to harvest. Carrion crawler brain juice makes the body of the target sluggish as the poison attacks muscles and essential tissues that help the body move. Longer exposure to brain juice causes a form of paralysis that makes it impossible for the victim to move a significant distance.

Named for its color and thickness, greenblood oil is a viscous poison derived from poisonous plants that grow deep in primeval forests. This combination of oils from several different sources has medicinal uses: It breaks up dangerous blood clots and can be used to help drain infections from the body. Assassins, however, use greenblood oil to make it more difficult for the body to heal. This poison is often used to make a target more vulnerable to harm rather than by harming directly. For example, an assassin might pour greenblood oil over a target&apos;s food early in the day before performing a very public assassination, to ensure that the victim cannot be magically healed once the attack takes place.

One of the few slow-acting poisons in the assassin&apos;s repertoire, nitharit poison gradually breaks down a creature&apos;s natural defenses against toxins and eventually turns those defenses against the poisoned creature. Nitharit poison is often used as a precursor to weaken a target before a second poisoning assault. For example, an assassin might put nitharit poison in a magistrate&apos;s wine, then later in the evening return to finish the job with a stronger poison once the target&apos;s body is in no shape to fight it off.

Ungol dust is a black powder made of the crushed remains of dried-up spiders and scorpions that is so fine that one errant breath can blow away an entire dose. Most of those who craft this poison wear masks to ensure that they do not accidentally disperse (or inhale) the dust before packing it into small, easily shattered pellets. When ungol dust comes into contact with flesh or other living material, it becomes highly corrosive.

This powder is derived from the legendary black lotus flower. The effect is devastating when this substance comes in contact with a creature for more than a few seconds. Black lotuses bloom only once every three years, and it is during that time that the flowers can be harvested to produce this toxic oil. Black lotuses grow only in deep swamps, along shadowed riverbanks, and at the edges of caves where they are sheltered from direct light.

Another poison designed to affect the mind as much as the body, insanity mist is a liquid that is only potent when made airborne and then inhaled. A liquid is distilled from the brains of mind f layer thralls (or mind flayers themselves, which produce a much higher quantity of poison) and combined with several kinds of mold spores to deliver the poison straight to the brain. Insanity mist begins eroding the consciousness of the victim almost instantly.

To those uneducated in the art of poison crafting, lich dust is often believed to be a powder made from the ground-up bones of liches. This belief is only partially correct; in truth, lich dust is made from a combination of pulverized bones taken from a variety of undead creatures (liches among them) mixed with other alchemical and natural substances. Lich dust retains some of the necromantic power that once animated the bones it is made from, which can drain the energy and spirit of creatures that consume it or are injured by a weapon coated with the poison.

The secret to creating this rare and potent toxin is closely guarded by the most powerful assassins&apos;s guilds. Versatile in its application, it not only does injury to a creature&apos;s body, it rots away flesh and bone, melts sinew, and boils the blood. Even after the initial shock of the effect of the venom is over, the pain and damage inf licted by the poison linger, making it difficult for the body to heal. The base of the poison is the venom from an actual wyvern, though the poison used by executioners is the result of a complex alchemical process that increases its potency tenfold.

Said to come from the pulverized bodies of angels devoted to gods of death, dark reaver powder has the ability to knock a creature unconscious for a long time. Assassins use dark reaver powder to get enemies out of the way without killing them or to send a message not to cross the wrong person. When applied in powder form to a weapon, the poison seeps into the blood and produces a diluted effect that renders enemies woozy for a short period of time.

The eyes of actual basilisks (harvested at great expense by adventurers) are dried out and ground into a powder that, when properly prepared, can turn its victims to stone. Assassins put small amounts of the powder into alchemical pellets that explode when broken to release a small cloud of the poison around the victim.

The garrote is a favorite weapon for silent executions. It gives the assassin a silent and efficient weapon for use on the unsuspecting. Though it is difficult to use a garrote on someone who is aware of its presence, assassins have been known to lie in wait for just the right moment when their target wanders too close, then reach out to strangle the target before he or she can react.

The proper application of bolas can bring down even the most nimble of enemies. Executioners frequently use bolas to keep their targets from escaping, since most creatures tend to flee from their killers on sight. However, this particular technique, which uses a specialized throwing motion to ensure maximum extension of the weapon, is also sometimes used to trip up pursuit when fleeing from the scene of an execution.

Though one of the weaker weapons in the executioner&apos;s repertoire, the blowgun is an excellent tool for ensuring that a poison is delivered directly to an opponent and not turned aside by armor that can deflect a dagger. This technique gives you pinpoint accuracy with the blowgun. A well-placed dart can even be lethal to weaker foes if it punctures a vital area.

The hand crossbow is one of the great equalizers when it comes to lethal ranged combat. Executioners often prefer to perform most of their assassinations up close, which can sometimes bring the assassin too close to other enemies. This particular quick-fire technique uses the hand crossbow to surprise and stagger nearby enemies long enough for the executioner to escape.

Mastering the ability to weave shadow magic to create illusions can be a useful skill for the assassin who wants to focus on subterfuge and misdirection. The images created by distracting illusion won&apos;st fool anyone who examines them closely or interacts with them. Instead, these illusions are meant to cover up the assassin&apos;s actions. For example, an assassin might create an illusion of the guard that the assassin just killed, standing at his assigned post, in order to fool observers into thinking the guard is still on duty. Alternatively, an assassin might lure his or her quarry out into the open by creating an illusion of a trusted companion beckoning the target urgently to where the assassin lurks in the shadows.

Summon the mists is a simple power that provides rudimentary cover against observation. It allows you to call up a bank of fog that rolls out from the shadows to conceal your actions. When used properly, it usually draws little attention from observers because the fog appears to be perfectly natural even as it conceals dark deeds.

Not every execution can be performed with only your victim present. Bodyguards, servants, and innocent bystanders sometimes interfere with assassinations. Darkness allows you to sow confusion by creating an area of pure, magical darkness that no light can penetrate. Those in the area of its effect cannot see you performing your lethal task. Some executioners also use this power to conceal their hiding places from outside observers; a wellplaced darkness effect can block the light of lamps and candles, making a room in an inn appear dark to observers who might be hunting the assassin just outside the window.

Executioners often mark their targets in some way before the assassination occurs. This power creates a singed, black sigil somewhere on the target&apos;s body that pulses with shadow magic. This mark creates a bond between the executioner and the target that gives the executioner the ability to detect the target with unerring accuracy. Once a death mark is placed, the assassin is rarely far behind.

A useful power that has saved the lives of many an executioner, eyes unseen allows the user to peer through walls, around corners, and even through ceilings and floors to see what lies ahead. It creates a small, invisible sensor crafted by shadow magic that can appear within a small radius and pass visions back to the assassin. Many executioners use eyes unseen to search for guards, keep an eye on pursuers, or reveal traps and ambushes before walking into them.

When you use walk through shadow, you create a brief, flickering shadow that whisks you quickly from one place to another. Unlike some other teleportation abilities, walk through shadow can take the user into unknown places and allows him or her to bypass walls, doors, and other barriers with a blind jump.

Assassins gain their abilities by following a training regimen developed by a particular guild. Even an assassin taught by an individual master studies a set of teachings that were once developed by a guild.
Assassins&apos; guilds claim towns and other territories as their hunting grounds. Nonguild assassins who seek to practice their art must first gain the permission of the local grandmaster of assassins. In some areas, particularly large cities that have many potential contracts, two guilds go to war for control of the slayers&apos; trade. In that situation, you must choose a side or face the wrath of both factions.
Choose a method of training. The choice you make gives you the benefit described below and also provides bonuses to certain assassin powers, as detailed in those powers.

As its name suggests, aboleth slime concentrate is created from the thick slime that coats the bodies of the aquatic subterranean aberrations. Calling the concentrate a "poison" is technically a misnomer, since it is not truly toxic, at least in a biological sense. Nevertheless, aboleth slime concentrate is charged with psionic power. When it enters the bloodstream of a sentient creature, it drastically lowers the victim's defenses against psychic attack.

Those brave (or foolish) enough to intentionally seek out the protoplasmic horrors known as gibbering beasts often do so for a very specific purpose. The hundreds of eyes that float within the gelatinous flesh of a gibbering beast can be removed, dried, and then ground into a fine powder. The powder, known as gibbering grind, is a potent psychic poison that causes its victims to unleash a torrent of blasphemous nonsense that can damage the minds of those nearby. </RulesElement>
Gibbering grind is usually made from the eyes of gibbering mouthers, but more powerful varieties derived from the eyes of gibbering abominations and gibbering orbs are rumored to exist.

Grell bile can be harvested from a number of organs in a grell's floating, sacklike body. In truth, it is not bile at all, but a distillation of the aberrant creature's blood and other bodily fluids. This fluid is extremely toxic and can drastically affect the hand–eye coordination of its victims.
Master assassins and poison crafters know that grell bile has an additional property beyond its common applications. Grells have powerful psionic abilities, and grell bile contains a trace of this ability. By imbibing a  amount of grell bile (at no small personal risk), the poisoner can establish a temporary psionic link to the victim. Through this link, an assassin has a chance to momentarily shunt any aggression the victim feels toward him or her onto a different target.

Umber dust is created from the pulverized eyes of umber hulks. It is highly toxic, and like many poisons crafted from aberrations with strong mental abilities, it also carries a powerful psionic effect. Those who survive the initial poisonous shock of umber dust suffer lingering confusion and often cannot tell friend  from foe. Like some other poisons created from the body parts of aberrations that have potent mind-affecting powers, umber dust offers additional benefits when the poisoner is familiar with its effects. By inhaling a small dose of umber dust, an assassin gains a measure of influence over where a poisoned target moves. This benefit is not without risk, however, and the assassin gambles that the umber dust will not cause significant harm to the assassin before he or she can poison a target.

An exceedingly rare and toxic poison, heart of mimic powder is derived from the central nerve bundle found in the fleshy core of object mimics. Its scarcity is due to the fact that mimics are not common, are exceedingly dangerous, and are more than intelligent enough to evade those who look to harvest their internal organs.
The effects of heart of mimic powder are as bizarre and lethal as the creature from which the poison is derived. The toxin relies on the mimic's polymorph ability, temporarily imposing a limited and debilitating version of the mimic's ooze form on the victim.

Only the bravest or most foolish assassins dare to harvest the body parts of mind f layers for poison crafting. Still, the practice occurs often enough that mind flayer tentacle extract is not an uncommon toxin among the greatest murderers of the Underdark.
The poison is elegant in its simplicity, since it scrambles the higher brain functions of its victims, temporarily leaving them completely vulnerable to an assassin's blade. Like grell bile and umber dust, mind flayer tentacle extract has an additional effect available to those assassins who are brave enough to sample the toxin themselves.
If an assassin imbibes a small amount of the extract before attacking, he or she can temporarily take on the most feared ability of the mind flayer and become able to control the actions of a victim. This benefit has an exceedingly dangerous drawback, since even a small amount of mind flayer tentacle extract also stuns the assassin, leaving the assassin nearly as vulnerable as his or her mark.

Power (Consumable * Poison): Standard Action. You pour the poison into a drink or onto a plate of food. The first creature to consume the food or drink within the next hour takes 20 poison damage, and the creature takes a -2 penalty to saving throws the end of its next extended rest. </specific>
