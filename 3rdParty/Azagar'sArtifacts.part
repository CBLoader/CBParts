    <Flavor> Orcbiter is one of the two magical weapons wielded by the famous eladrin ranger, Dolarion Silvershadow. It is imbued with the ranger's skill with two weapons and the eladrin race's hatred of evil humanoids, especially orcs.
	  
Orcbiter is of obvious eladrin manufacture. The weapon features an elaborately constructed single-bitted head, pierced with a stylized waning moon, and etched with its name in elven script. Its handle is slightly curved and constructed of steel-reinforced walnut. Orcbiter's blade is exceedingly sharp, and never seems to lose its edge, no matter how much it is used.
The axe OrcBiter is a +2 enfeebling handaxe with the following properties and powers. </Flavor>

Goals of OrcBiter
* Help the eladrin and elves protect their forest homes.
* Bring death and destruction to the orc race.
* Become part of a set with another powerful melee weapon, and be wielded by a ranger (preferably an eladrin or elf ).

Roleplaying OrcBiter
Orcbiter has a rather flamboyant personality, and is prone to rattling off the deeds of past owners, such as Dolarion Silvershadow, to galvanize its wielder into action. It speaks to its wielder in an airy, feminine voice that can be as light and musical as a summer breeze when the weapon is pleased, or as sharp as a sleet storm in the heart of winter when it is not. Orcbiter's voice can be heard by others, an obvious sign of its magical power and worth. Orcbiter pushes its owner to seek out and destroy orcs, and to ally with elves, eladrin, and other fey creatures.

Normal (5-11)
"Orcbiter asks for my loyalty to the fey and my dedication to eliminating the orcish threat."
	Orcbiter is optimistic yet reserved with a new owner. It waits for the character to reveal his true intentions and motivations before giving its full support.

Unsatisfied (1-4)
"The orc threat grows, and I have done little to stop it."
	The wielder is not seeking out orcs to slay, and may even be battling fey creatures. Orcbiter is unhappy, and urges its wielder to devote himself to its cause. If the wielder continues on his current course, the axe will leave.

Moving On
"I have served Orcbiter well, but it must leave me now."
	The orcs in the wielder's region has been defeated or weakened, and Orcbiter wants to go where the orcs still threaten the eladrin and the fey in general. When its wielder next gains a level, Orcbiter disappears, its magic and power appearing where it is most needed. If the axe is at least satisfied, it leaves in its place a +3 enfeebling handaxe, and its wielder gains a permanent +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls against orcs.

	When Dolarion Silvershadow was slain, it was the work of two orc chieftains, Urkon Irontusk and Vorgga Two-Hammers, who conspired together to bring down the legendary enemy of their people. Both mighty orc chieftains and over two dozen orc warriors ambushed Dolarion on the outskirts of the Ithoriel Forest, and although the eladrin ranger fought ferociously, he could not overcome such an overwhelming force. When the battle was over, Urkon Irontusk claimed Dolarion's sword Warwand and Vorgga Two-Hammers claimed the ranger's handaxe Orcbiter. Then, the two chieftains went their separate ways, each bearing a vital piece of eladrin history. Now, some twenty years after Dolarion's death, his wife, Ioria Silvershadow, seeks to reclaim Orcbiter and Warwand so that her young son may someday take up both weapons and continue his father's work. Recently, Ioria and her allies have tracked down Vorgga Two-Hammers, who still possesses Orcbiter, and seek a noble group of heroes to return the famous eladrin weapon to its rightful owners.
	
OrcBiter Lore
Arcana or History DC 20: Orcbiter is one of the two famous weapons once wielded by the famous eladrin ranger,
Dolarion Silvershadow. Dolarion was renowned for his battles with the orc tribes around the Ithoriel Forest, and it is said that he slew no less than one thousand orcs before disappearing on the outskirts of the forest he had protected for decades. Orcbiter was used in Dolarion's left hand, while he wielded his enchanted longsword, Warwand, in his right. It is believed that the eladrin ranger finally ran afoul of more orcs that even he could handle, and that both his famous weapons are now in the hands of his most hated enemies.

    <Flavor> The Sabre of the Horselords was once the weapon of Obari Khan, the feared Drugari warlord that united his people into a single devastating army. It is imbued with the Khan's indomitable spirit, skill at arms, and mastery of all things related to mounted combat.
	  
The Sabre of the Horselords is styled in the fashion of the Drugari horselords. Its blade is narrow, single-edged, and tapers delicately to a sharp, thrusting point. Its hilt is wrapped in silver wire and features a spiked knuckle guard of brass and iron. The Sabre sheds no light, but does bear the sigil of Ruadran, the Drugari god of horses.

Goals of the Sabre of the Horselords
* Attach itself to a hero renowned for his skill at mounted warfare.
* Prove itself against other mounted warriors.
* Slay hobgoblins.

Roleplaying Sabre of the Horselords
The Sabre of the Horselords exists to slaughter foes from the back of a charging mount. It is only satisfied when its wielder is flourishing it in the midst of a cavalry charge, or cutting down enemies on foot as they flee before its wielder's mount. In addition, due to its long interment with the hobgoblin warmaster Azagar, the Sabre has an abiding hatred of all hobgoblins and urges its wielder to attack them whenever possible. The Sabre communicates with its wielder in only the simplest emotional urges, usually nothing more that raw anger or childish elation.

CONCORDANCE
&lt;table&gt;Starting score	5
Owner gains a level	+1d10
Owner rides a mount of his level or higher	+2
Owner defeats an enemy of his level or higher while mounted (maximum 1/day)	+1
Owner defeats a hobgoblin of his level or higher (maximum 1/day)	+1
Owner defeats an enemy of his level or higher while on foot (maximum 1/day)	-2
Owner is forcefully dismounted while in combat	-1&lt;/table&gt;

Pleased (16-20)
"The great Khan would be pleased by our victories."
	The Sabre of the Horselords is thrilled to have an owner that is both a powerful warrior and a master equestrian.

Property: You receive a +1 item bonus to all defenses even while on foot. When mounted, the bonuses increase to a +2 item bonus to all defenses. This supercedes the normal bonuses granted by the artifact.
Power (Daily): Minor Action. While mounted, you call forth an aura of fear (aura 2) that lasts until the end of your next turn. All enemies within the aura suffer a penalty of 1 to attack and damage rolls against you. Enemies on foot suffer a penalty of 2 to attack and damage rolls.

Satisfied (12-15)
"They shall flee before us!"
	The Sabre is happy with its owner's skill at mounted combat. It urges him on to greater endeavors by expending more of its energy to keep him in the saddle.

Property: You receive a bonus of 5 to saving throws to avoid being knocked prone while mounted (forcefully dismounted).

Normal (5-11)
"Many enemies await the taste of steel and the horror of pounding hooves."
	The Sabre urges its wielder to seek out enemies worthy of fighting, especially other mounted warriors or hobgoblins.

Unsatisfied (1-4)
"This may be too fine a weapon for one such as I."
	The Sabre is unhappy with its current owner, who is likely spending too much time afoot or acting in a cowardly manner.

Special: Enemies on foot gain a bonus of 1 to attack and damage rolls against you.

Angered (0 or lower)
"The great Khan laughs at my failure from the afterlife."
	The Sabre's wielder is entirely unsuitable, and the sword will not tolerate such an unworthy master for long.

Enhancement: The artifact's enhancement bonuses drops to +1
Critical: +1d6 damage, or +1d8 damage while mounted
Special: Enemies on foot gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls against you.

Moving On
"The horselords shall sing songs of our exploits."
	The Sabre of the Horselords has seen its owner slaughter many powerful enemies and display near peerless skill at mounted combat. It recognizes that other warriors may grow just as great by the benefit of its powers. When its wielder next gains a level, Saddlescourge disappears, and its sentience and powers appear in a distant land for another skilled equestrian to find. If the sword is at least satisfied, it leaves in its place a +3 doomrider scimitar for its former owner to wield in its place.
	
	Sir Navar Blacktree is a hedge knight of surpassing martial skill who possesses little of the qualities that make a knight a knight. He is cruel and wicked, and when unable to attach himself to a noble house in need of competent soldiers, he happily turns brigand. Recently, Sir Navar attacked and killed a group of Drugari horsemen while they slept beside the road. Little did Sir Navar know that one of the Drugari he killed was Zota Khan, a powerful Drugari warlord, travelling in secret to the lands of his cousin in the east. Zota carried his birthright, the powerful sword the Sabre, which has been passed down by the horselords in his family for centuries. Already an accomplished rider, the Sabre has transformed Sir Navar into a mounted terror, and he has been challenging those he meets to a knightly duel on horseback. Those who refuse Sir Navar's challenge are killed out of hand and robbed. To date, those who have accepted the challenge have been no match for Sir Navar and the Sabre. Growing bolder with each murder, Sir Navar has gathered a small group of brigands and is quickly on his way to becoming a true brigand lord. That is, unless, a group of heroes can put an end to the robber knight's predations.
	
Sabre of the Horselords Lore:
History DC 18: The Sabre of the Horselords was once the weapon of Obari Khan, the feared Drugari warlord that united his people into a single devastating army. Obari, however, underestimated his neighbors to the south, the hobgoblin Imperial Horde, and began a series of probing raids along the border between the two nations. The hobgoblins quickly tired of Obari's antagonizing and sent a large force of hobgoblin legionnaires, accompanied by two thousand goblin wolf-riders to confront the Khan. After taking the brunt of a series of hit and run skirmishes, the hobgoblins eventually cornered Obari and smashed his army, killing the Khan in the process.

    <Flavor> Yarghul's Rattle is one of the magical items associated with the dread gnoll necromancer Yarghul Rotfang. The rattle has a twisted, maleficent intellect and is rumored to have powers over the undead.
	  
At first glance, Yarghul's Rattle seems quite innocuous and primitive. It consists of a dried gourd attached to a piece of dear antler with rawhide. A string of hyena fangs and raven feathers wrap around the antler where it joins the gourd. Inside the gourd are half a dozen finger bones taken from the corpses of good-aligned paladins and clerics. These small bones make a rattling noise when Yarghul's Rattle is shaken; however, the noise is far louder than it should be, and has a terrible grating quality to creatures that are not evil-aligned.
Yarghul's Rattle is a death rattle. While the Rattle is in hand, it is considered to be a +3 rod or +3 wand, gaining all the properties of that type of implement. </Flavor>

Power (Encounter * Arcane, Fear, Implement, Thunder): Standard Action: You may use Howl of Doom (warlock 7).

Power (Daily * Charm): Standard Action. You may attempt to dominate any undead creature with fewer levels than you:

Goals of Yarghul's Rattle
* Help the gnoll race and the demon lord it venerates rise to power.
* Attach itself to a powerful and evil spellcaster, preferably an evil cleric or warlock that desires to become a lich or other powerful undead.
* Create and control undead creatures.

Roleplaying Yarghul's Rattle
Yarghul's Rattle is a thoroughly twisted and evil item, and it urges its wielder to commit depraved acts with the dead and undead to bring him closer to the "secrets" of undeath. When in hand, the Rattle communicates in a low, guttural voice that only its owner can hear. When the Rattle is not in hand, and simply on the owner's person, it can only communicate through rough emotional urges.

CONCORDANCE
&lt;table&gt;Starting score	5

Owner or an ally kills a gnoll or undead creature (maximum 1/encounter)	-2
Owner is good or lawful good	-2
Owner is unaligned	-1&lt;/table&gt;

Pleased (16-20)
"The Rattle and I shall raise an army of death, and bring woe upon the forces of light."
	The Rattle is pleased to have such a vile and twisted owner. It generally lets its owner do as he pleases, quite confident that it has found a truly wicked and powerful individual.

Yarghul's Rattle's enhancement increases to +4.
Critical: +4d6 necrotic damage.
Power (Daily * Healing): Minor Action. You call forth an aura of necrotic invigoration (aura 5) that lasts until the end of your next turn. All undead that begin their turn in the aura regain 10 hit points. Each living enemy that start its turn within the aura is weakened until the start of its next turn.

Satisfied (12-15)
"The Rattle has shown me the path to true power."
	The Rattle is generally satisfied with its owner, although it does not consider him the absolute ideal master. It might urge its wielder to pass it on to a more potent servant of evil, if one is encountered.

Property: Undead with an Intelligence score of 2 or below must roll a saving throw to attack you. If the save is failed, the undead creature must choose another target for the attack.
Power (Encounter): Standard Action. You can use Ferocious Charge (gnoll racial power).

Normal (5-11)
"I can sense the Rattle's desires and feel its dark power."
	Yarghul's Rattle makes its desires known immediately when it acquires a new owner. It relates what it expects of its owner, and warns him of his fate if he should displease it.

Unsatisfied (1-4)
"The Rattle is displeased; I must devote myself more fully to the mastery death."
	
Special: You begin to find the presence of the living to be intolerable. When you are adjacent to a living creature you take a penalty of 2 to attack rolls and saving throws.

Angered (0 or lower)
"The Rattle urges me to do horrible things...to myself!"
	The Rattle finds its current wielder unfitting in the extreme and actively seeks his or her demise. It will turn against its wielder at the first opportunity, especially if a more suitable owner appears.

Yarghul's Rattle's enhancement drops to +2.
Critical: +2d6 necrotic damage.
Special: You gain vulnerable radiant 10. Also, when you are exposed to direct sunlight you take a penalty of 2 to all defenses and cannot regain hit points.

Moving On
"Death has always been my destiny; the Rattle has helped me fulfill it."
	The Rattle's wielder completes his or her apotheosis into a lich, vampire, or other powerful undead. The Rattle has succeeded in creating a new and powerful evil in the world. When the character next gains a level, the Rattle disappears, travelling to another part of the world where a burgeoning necromancer might find it and begin his or her journey towards undeath. If the Rattle is pleased with its last owner, it leaves a common death rattle in its place.

	Varmog Rotfang, a gnoll necromancer and lesser scion of the Rotfang clan, has come into possession of Yarghul's Rattle. Hoping to follow in his ancestor's dark footsteps, Varmog has been using the Rattle to help him create an army of undead. Seeking a ready source of fresh corpses, Varmog has been kidnapping human travelers, killing them, and then transforming their corpses into skeletons and zombies. At present, he has only a small number of combatready undead; however, driven by the will of the Rattle, his attacks are becoming bolder and bolder, as he seeks to increase the numbers of his undead warriors.
	
Yarghul's Rattle's Lore
Arcana or Religion DC 22: The foul gnoll necromancer Yarghul Rotfang was infamous for his control over the undead,
and it is said that the majority of this power stemmed from a unique magical item known as Yarghul's Rattle. With the Rattle in hand, Yarghul could summon forth undead monstrosities or compel free-willed undead into his service. This necromantic power allowed the evil gnoll to rise to the leadership of his tribe, and finally, all of the tribes in the Azmunadai Mountains.
Arcana or Religion DC 27: With an army of gnolls and undead at his command, Yarghul attempted to extend
his influence into the lands of the Imperial Hobgoblins to the east. However, Yarghul vastly underestimated the strength and organization of the hobgoblin legions, and was slain while besieging a fortified keep on the border of hobgoblin lands. Yarghul's possessions, along with the Rattle, were taken from his body after the gnolls were defeated. The current whereabouts of the Rattle are unknown.
