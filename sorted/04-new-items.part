Goals of the Coat of Eyes
• Attach itself to a character touched by the Prophecy, who will see the events that shape the future.
• Evaluate the bearer and his allies, to assess their usefulness or threat to the daelkyr.
• Observe events that enlighten and amuse the daelkyr Belashyrra.
Roleplaying the Coat of Eyes
The Coat of Eyes communicates its desires through strange whispers and bursts of alien emotion that surge in the
wearer's mind. The wearer feels the Coat's pleasure when it observes something interesting through him or her, but feels its fury if the wearer intentionally avoids sights or experiences that the Coat deems worthy. Occasionally, the wearer feels the presence of another mind, seemingly held within his own: perhaps Belashyrra, gazing out through his creation.
Concordance
Starting Score 5
Owner gains a level +1d8
Owner observes an event of interest to Belashyrra +1 (maximum 1/day)
Owner discovers a Prophecy Mark +1
Owner kills a Gatekeeper druid +1 (maximum 1/encounter)
Owner covers the Coat of Eyes #x2013;1 (initial action, and every hour it remains covered)
Pleased (16-20)
"Soon I will know all that I need."
The Coat of Eyes knows that its wearer is touched by destiny, and Belashyrra has learned much through the wearer's eyes.
Property: The artifact's item bonus to Perception checks increases to +3, but the penalty to Insight checks increases
to #x2013;3.
Property: You gain resist 10 psychic, resist 10 poison, and resist 10 necrotic. This supersedes the normal resistances granted by the artifact.
Power (Daily): Standard Action. You gain blindsight 5 until the end of the encounter.
Satisfied (12#x2013;15)
"I hunger for more knowledge."
The Coat of Eyes is eager to see what its wearer can accomplish. The Coat's enhancement bonus to AC increases to +2.
Property: You gain low-light vision.
Property: The artifact's item bonus to Perception checks increases to +2, while the penalty to Insight checks increases to -2.
Normal (5#x2013;11)
"Show me what this world has to offer."
The Coat of Eyes is hungry to see new and important things, and its wearer can feel the artifact's desire.
Unsatisfied (1#x2013;4)
"Do not hide your secrets from me."
The Coat of Eyes urges its wearer to seek worthy sights, even as its alien emotions become distracting and hostile.
Property: You take a #x2013;3 penalty to Perception checks and Insight checks. This supersedes the bonuses and penalties normally granted by the artifact.
Property: You lose the resist 5 psychic normally granted by the artifact.
Angered (0 or Lower)
"You take my sight? I will take your life!"
The Coat of Eyes seeks to punish its wearer, urging him or her to abandon the artifact so that it can be found by someone else.
Property: You take a #x2013;3 penalty to Perception checks and Insight checks. This supersedes the bonuses and penalties normally granted by the artifact.
Property: You lose the resist 5 psychic normally granted by the artifact and gain vulnerable 5 psychic.
Moving On
"Together, we have seen all that can be seen."
Belashyrra has seen enough of the world through the wearer's eyes, and he wishes to sever the connection before the character grows too powerful. When the wearer next gains a level, the eyes that stud the Coat wither, leaving a suit of +2 deathcut leather or +2 deathcut hide. In addition, the wearer gains a permanent +1 bonus to Perception checks but takes a permanent #x2013;1 penalty to Insight checks-along with the eerie sensation that Belashyrra is still using his or her eyes to see the world. If the Coat of Eyes moved on because it was unsatisfied with the user, the armor crumbles into worthless dust.

		<specific name="Tier"> Paragon </specific>
		<specific name="Lore"> 	Nature DC 15: The Beast of Talgora died long ago, but that hasn't prevented its spirit, consumed by undying primal rage, from trying to force its way back to life. The legendary creature's remains are still capable of channeling a portion of its unbridled power. When items made from its body are brought together, they can exert an insidious influence over their owners.
	Nature DC 20: When the items are separated, they gently and subtly pull toward one another. An individual wielding one item might find himself or herself inexplicably drawn to the location of another. As the number of items in proximity increases, so does the pull toward the others. If the items are again separated, the intelligence that they display as a set weakens accordingly.
	Nature DC 25: Legends suggest that when the Beast of Talgora's remains are brought together, their powers grow proportionally. The beast can be restored to life when all of the existing items are reunited. Destroying individual items does not prevent the beast from returning, but its strength will be diminished because of the absent pieces.
	Nature DC 30: Those of the Black Call have secreted themselves away to continue their research. They have been aware of the Returning Beast and its intentions for some time. Individual members take whatever precautions they deem appropriate; some have acquired one or two of the items and hidden them in what they believe are secure places.
		</specific>
		<specific name="Set Items"> ID_FMP_MAGIC_ITEM_10112,ID_FMP_MAGIC_ITEM_10113,ID_FMP_MAGIC_ITEM_10114,ID_FMP_MAGIC_ITEM_10115,ID_FMP_MAGIC_ITEM_10116,ID_FMP_MAGIC_ITEM_10117 </specific>
		<specific name="Benefits"> ID_FMP_ITEM_SET_BENEFIT_85,ID_FMP_ITEM_SET_BENEFIT_86 </specific>
Such a wellspring of life as the Beast of Talgora cannot be quelled forever. The beast possesses such a burning will to live that, despite its having been ”slain,” its spirit yet claws ceaselessly behind death's door. It persists within the collection of magic items known as the Returning Beast.
	Each item is composed of a portion of the beast's body. To make good on its return, it must find and reunite those hidden pieces of its carcass. As its strength grows, it will feed its hunger for vengeance against the Black Call by tracking its members down one by one and destroying them without mercy.
	The item set is a collection of six paragon tier magic items: bands of equilibrium, eye of prophecy, razortail, ring of the deep wood, blade of the stalking predator, and totem of the dancing leaf. These items house the remaining essence of the Beast of Talgora. As pieces are brought together, a primal intelligence becomes apparent to the items' wielders. If all of the items are reunited, the Beast of Talgora's spirit will try to force its way back into the world with the help of whoever  possesses the items, whether or not those possessors are willing agents.
	The Beast of Talgora's spirit cannot control the items that house it or those that wield them, but its powerful presence is always felt. It doesn't speak, but its intense emotions and broken, violent thoughts bubble constantly through the minds of its wielders. It subtly urges its wielders to push forward, to seek out its remains, and to hunt members of the Black Call. It craves conf lict of every kind and urges characters toward any that comes within reach. It favors brashness and confidence.
Goals of the Returning Beast
* Return to life.
* Exact revenge on the Black Call.
* Destroy anyone and anything in its way.

Goals of the Dreamheart
	• Suborn wielders to take up the star pact to serve the Eldest
	• Wake the Eldest aboleth
	• Shatter the walls of the world and so leave it naked to the influence of the Far Realm
Roleplaying the Dreamheart
	The Dreamheart communicates through dreams. It projects the barest hints of eldritch secrets into the wielder's mind, as well as images of the wielder enjoying the fruits of vast power after learning further forbidden lore. The Dreamheart tempts its wielder solely through the great power it offers, apparently free for the asking. The evil of the Dreamheart is not active but rather a slow, seeping influence of corruption. Its agency replies upon the greed and suggestibility of someone already foolish enough to take up and wield a petrified piece of an evil proto-deity.
	Warlocks who use the Dreamheart are compelled to shift to the star pact if that is not already their pact. Clerics who use the Dreamheart are compelled over a period of weeks to revere the Eldest as if it was their deity.
Concordance
	Unlike most artifacts, the Dreamheart functions at full power, as if with full concordance, for any creature that can use it as an implement. Using the artifact's encounter and daily powers does involve some risk. At the end of a turn when the wielder used any of the Dreamheart's encounter or daily powers, roll a d20. If a 1 is rolled, the eye in the stone opens of its own accord; see “Eye of the Eldest” below to resolve the effect. The Dreamheart then vanishes and is lost (see “Moving On” below).
Moving On
“The darkness in the pupil's center rushes out. The Dreamheart falls into that darkness, and is gone.”
	The Dreamheart was only recently plucked from the Eldest's body. As such, the artifact has no storied past; it has only passed through a handful of wielders. Each time a wielder consciously or accidentally causes the eye to shutter open, the Eldest aboleth wakes to a light doze and makes some change to the world, before slipping back into deeper slumber. However, one day the Eldest's eye will not shut. On that day, the Eldest will fully rouse, and the Abolethic Sovereignty will come into its own.
EYE OF THE ELDEST
	If the eye of the Dreamheart opens, refer to the table below. Regardless of what else happens, the Dreamheart vanishes as described under “Moving On.”
EYE OF THE ELDEST TABLE
Trigger: The wielder purposefully opens the Dreamheart eye or rolls a 1 on a d20 after using a Dreamheart power during the turn.
&lt;table&gt;2d6	Effect
2	Trapped In Xxiphu
3-4	Scourge of Kuo-Toa
5-9	Comes the Sovereignty
10-11	Timespace Sojourn
12	Behold the Tyrant&lt;/table&gt;
Trapped In Xxiphu
Effect (Immediate Reaction): The Dreamheart immediately Moves On, and you fall unconscious and cannot be awakened. Your soul has been sucked down into the mind of the Eldest in the abolethic city of Xxiphu.
	Major Quest: Free the Soul The remaining characters must find Xxiphu and enter it to release your bound soul. Xxiphu may be deep beneath the earth, on another plane, or hovering ten miles over the Sea of Fallen Stars and guarded by gravity-defying kraken and aboleth overseers. Your soul is trapped within the stratified memories of the Eldest, which manifests as a wall of icelike crystal deep inside Xxiphu. If the ice is shattered, your soul is released and you regain consciousness.
	Ask your DM to allow you to create a temporary character to play until your trapped character is found and released. If your original character is finally released, transfer any XP gained by your temporary character to your original character, in addition to any XP earned from the quest.
	Quest XP: 16,000 XP
Scourge of Kuo-Toa
Effect (Immediate Reaction): Two kuo-toa lashes (Monster Manual 3 page 125) appear in adjacent, empty squares within 10 squares of you. The kuo-toas begin play under your command and act on your initiative. You must spend a standard action each turn to sustain the effect. If you fail to do so, you lose control of the kuo-toas and they become your enemies until they are defeated. At the end of the encounter or when the kuo-toas are defeated, they (or their bodies) disappear.
Comes the Sovereignty
Effect (Immediate Reaction): An aboleth overseer (Monster Manual page 8) appears in an empty square within 10 squares of you. The aboleth begins play under your command and acts on your initiative. You must spend a standard action each turn to sustain the effect. If you fail to do so, you lose control of the aboleth and it becomes your enemy until it is defeated. At the end of the encounter, when 5 minutes have passed, or when the aboleth is defeated, it (or its body) disappears.
Timespace Sojourn
Effect (Immediate Reaction): A soundless explosion of purple light tears a hole in reality in an empty square adjacent to you. You and your allies within 10 squares of you are pulled into the maw like flies on a frog's tongue. You find yourself in an empty, extradimensional space that is a mote of eroded stone 5 squares wide and 5 squares long. The mote appears to float in an infinite vault of darkness in which only a scattering of ancient, dying stars yet burn. The extradimensional space is separate from the world or other planes of existence and lasts for 8 hours. At the end of 8 hours, the mote dissolves, and you and all creatures in the space reappear in the squares where you were before the timespace sojourn. At that point, 8 hours have passed for you, but the DM determines how much time has passed in the world. It may be that no time at all passed from where and when this effect was triggered, that 8 hours passed, or that some longer period of days, months, or years has elapsed.
Behold the Tyrant
Effect (Immediate Reaction): A beholder eye of shadow (Monster Manual 3 page 22) appears in an empty space within 10 squares of you. If that space gives the eye of shadow superior cover or total concealment, it can make an immediate Stealth check to become hidden. The beholder begins play under your command and acts on your initiative. You must spend a full round action (a minor, a move, and standard action) each turn to sustain the effect. If you fail to do so, you lose control of the beholder and it becomes your enemy until it is defeated. At the end of the encounter, when 5 minutes have passed, or when the beholder is defeated, it (or its body) disappears.

Crown of Dust Lore
	History DC 20: A milennium ago, Ul-Athra was bested by the Dragon. The beast clove the primordial's crown into three parts, all of which were lost to history.
Goals of the Crown
* Be reunited into a whole item once again.
* Find and resurrect or free Ul-Athra.
Roleplaying the Fragment
This fragment of the Crown of Dust doesn't know where to find its other fragments or the remains of Ul-Athra. It has a hazy memory of events before the Dragon struck the Crown from the primordial's head.
CONCORDANCE
&lt;table&gt;Starting Score	5
Owner gains a level	+1d10
Each fragment of the Crown joined to the first	+1
Owner defeats an immortal (1/day)	+2
Owner or ally attacks an elemental (1/encounter)	-2
Owner defeats enemy without Crown's aid (1/encounter)	-1&lt;/table&gt;
Pleased (16–20)
“Soon, Ul-Athra will be found and restored to life!”
	The fragment is delighted because its host has shown a strong desire to revive the ancient primordial.
Property: You gain resist 15 poison.
Power (Encounter): Immediate Interrupt. Trigger: An enemy within 5 squares of you fails a saving throw. Effect: The fragment's daily power recharges.
Satisfied (12–15)
“We're making progress, surely? Perhaps the next dune holds Ul-Athra's remains or my lost fragments!”
	The fragment recognizes the efforts made by its host and hopes that they continue.
Property: You gain resist 10 poison.
Property: Each enemy within 5 squares of you has vulnerable 5 poison.
Power (Encounter): Free Action. Trigger: You score a critical hit on an enemy. Effect: The target takes ongoing 10 poison damage (save ends).
Normal (5–11)
“I am troubled. What if I never find my creator?”
	The fragment is forlorn by its host's failure to find Ul-Athra and its missing pieces.
Unsatisfied (1–4)
“Are you even trying to help me?”
	The fragment is displeased with an owner who seems unwilling to search out Ul-Athra's remains. Until the artifact's concordance improves, it grants no powers, but its properties still apply.
Angered (0 or Lower)
“You've been deceiving me all along!”
	The fragment, enraged, punishes its host until the character's behavior improves or the artifact decides to move on. It grants no powers or properties.
Moving On
“A curse upon you until your bloodline fails!”
	The fragment disappears in a flash of virulent purple light, most likely while its host is engaged in combat.

Goals of the Heartwood Spear
Unlike some other artifacts, the Heartwood Spear has no true sentience or greater will behind it. Instead, the primal spirits of the world decide the fate of the spear and its wielder. Many primal guardians believe that the few remaining primal spirits of the world take an active role in guiding the wielder of the spear and use the wielder as a tool to reduce the threat of further defiling. Any goals and concordance seemingly expressed or displayed by the spear originate from the primal spirits that have a vested interest in the use of the artifact—they do not originate from the spear.
	♦ Destroy all defilers, especially the sorcerer-kings.
	♦ Help restore the life force of Athas.
	♦ Protect the few remaining verdant reaches of Athas against destruction.
	♦ Restore the inf luence of the primal spirits over the peoples of Athas.
Roleplaying the Heartwood Spear
Though the Heartwood Spear has no ability to interact with a character who wields it, the primal spirits that watch over the spear might manifest themselves to the wielder. For example, while heroes are camped at an oasis, the wielder of the Heartwood Spear might see a vision of a spectral f loating mantle beckoning him or her away from the camp. Once away from other ears, the creature speaks in a human voice, conveying the desires of the primal spirits. 	Other forms of interaction could include subtle cues from nature (for example, a strong gust of wind pushing the wielder down one path when confronted with a fork in the road) or actual intervention in times of crisis (such as a primal spirit possessing the body of the wielder to give the hero more strength in battle).
	The concordance of the Heartwood Spear represents the wielder's esteem in the minds of the primal spirits that oversee the artifact's use. As the wielder gains the favor of those primal spirits by bringing the spear closer to fulfilling its intended purpose, those spirits unlock more of the spear's abilities. If the wielder acts in a way that earns the spirits' disdain, the wielder might find that the spirits have placed an effect on the artifact to make the wielder want to cast it aside.

Pleased (16–20)
“With this spear, I shall free the city-states from the tyranny of the Dragon.”
The primal spirits are pleased with the wielder of the Heartwood Spear. They bless the wielder with the ability to lash out at defilers who are far more powerful than the wielder, to encourage heroes to step forward and attempt what they would otherwise consider impossible.
	Property: You gain resist 15 necrotic.
	Property: You roll two dice for attack rolls against defilers and the Dragon of Tyr, using either result. If an effect lets you reroll an attack roll and you rolled twice because of this property, you reroll both dice. If an effect causes you to roll twice for an attack roll and use either the higher or the lower result, this property cannot be used with that attack.
	Power (Daily): Free Action. Trigger: You hit a defiler that is higher in level than you with a weapon attack using his spear. Effect: Until the end of the encounter, that defiler takes a -4 penalty to attack rolls and all defenses.
Satisfied (12–15)
“Truly I wield the bane of the sorcerer-kings. Its power is now the power of the enslaved.”
The primal spirits are satisfied with the wielder of the Heartwood Spear, but they could be better placated. Primal spirits might still communicate their desires to him or her, but they do so rarely. Great defilers such as the Dragon and the sorcerer-kings still roam the world, and Athas's primal spirits will not be satisfied until these enemies are destroyed. To aid in this process, the weapon begins to exude a sap that is anathema to the vile creatures of Athas.
	Property: You gain resist 10 necrotic.
	Power (Daily ♦ Poison, radiant): Free Action. Trigger: You hit an enemy with a weapon attack using this spear. Effect: The enemy takes ongoing 15 poison and radiant damage (save ends).
Normal (5–11)
“So, this is the spear that slew Kalak? Such a small thing to bring down an ancient tyrant.”
The primal spirits wait to see whether the wielder of the Heartwood Spear takes actions that please them. The spear has great power, but the wielder has not yet unlocked its potential.
Unsatisfied (1–4)
“A force of the natural world sets itself against me as long as I carry the spear.”
The primal spirits don't believe that the wielder of the Heartwood Spear has goals that align with theirs. For now, the artifact gives warning by lashing out at its wielder from time to time and letting its venomous sap sting in the wound.
	Property: You gain vulnerable 5 poison and lose any poison resistance you have.
	Property: When you roll a natural 1 on any weapon attack using this spear, you take ongoing 5 damage (save ends).
Angered (0 or lower)
“The spear is not mine to own; I fear that someone—or something—is coming for it even as we speak.”
The primal spirits no longer want the wielder of the Heartwood Spear to have the artifact, and they begin communicating this fact to those who serve them. It won't be long before the spear's chosen guardians come to claim it.
	Property: You gain vulnerable 10 poison and lose any poison resistance you have.
	Property: When you roll a natural 1 on any weapon attack using this spear, you take ongoing 5 damage (save ends).
	Property: You grant combat advantage while holding or carrying the spear.
Moving On
“All things must fade in time; for this spear, it is time once more to become a part of the land.”
The Heartwood Spear is guarded jealously by the primal spirits and their servants. It is unlikely to remain in the hands of one wielder for long. Once the weapon has been used for the purpose its primal spirit guardians have set before the wielder, or once the wielder veers too far away from their plans, the spirits that oversee the Heartwood Spear either manifest and reclaim it or order one of their servants to do so. Like the natural world, the Heartwood Spear obeys a cycle of life and death, ascending in importance in the world before fading back into obscurity for a time. When the primal spirits deem it necessary, the spear will rise to prominence again just as spring renews that which dies in winter.
	Not every wielder of the Heartwood Spear is willing to give it up once he or she is meant to be done with it. When this happens, the primal spirits set their power against that of the wielder. In most cases, the primal spirits command their servants to seize the artifact and punish its wielder. A character who refuses to give up the weapon might find a horde of halflings closing in, eager to take back the spear at any cost. In rare cases, the spirits themselves might intervene and confront the spear's user directly.
	When the Heartwood Spear is surrendered to the primal spirits or their designated guardian, the artifact is carried to a secret location and transformed once more into a vibrant and ancient oak tree.

Goals of the Orbs of Kalid-Ma
	• To be reunited with all the other Orbs of Kalid-Ma, restoring Kalid-Ma's mind to his body.
	• To oppose the efforts of the Dragon of Tyr, Hamanu, Kalak, and King Tithian, Kalak's replacement.
	• To destroy the Dragon of Tyr.
	• To travel to shadow Kalidnay and find Thakok-An, possibly punishing her for her failure.
Roleplaying an orb of Kalid-Ma
	Each of the Orbs of Kalid-Ma lacks a complete personality, but does possess enough of Kalid-Ma's mind to have purpose and will. An orb gives its wielder delusions of grandeur and invincibility. A person in possession of an orb also feels a strong compulsion to cast aside former interests to dedicate all time and effort to psionic and arcane studies. Every orb wishes for a wielder that is a master of psionics or arcane magic. Such a mystic is better equipped to reunite all five orbs.
Concordance
	The Orbs of Kalid-Ma are unlike other artifacts, in that they do not respond to the growing power of their wielder. Instead, Orbs of Kalid-Ma seek out those who bring them closer to each other, and they reward anyone who takes steps toward restoring Kalid-Ma's mind.
&lt;table&gt;Starting Score	5
Owner takes the orb to Kalidnay	+5
Owner melds another Orb of Kalid-Ma	+5
Owner has the templar theme	+2
Owner has psionic power points	+2
Owner uses arcane defiling (1/day)	+1
Owner ends a day without having used the orb as an implement	-2
Owner acts against Kalidnay's interests	-2&lt;/table&gt;
Pleased (16–20)
“I hear the voice of Kalid-Ma.”
	The Orb of Kalid-Ma seeks to reward the wielder for his or her efforts in restoring Kalid-Ma to life. It shows frequent scenes of Kalid-Ma and Kalidnay before the catastrophe, giving the user visions of Kalid-Ma's glory days.
Property: Whenever you make an attack that has the psychic keyword, you can score a critical hit on a roll of 19—20.
Power (Daily): Standard Action. Effect: You and all allies within 10 squares of you can instantly travel to the outskirts of either ruined Kalidnay or shadow Kalidnay.
Satisfied (12–15)
“A dragon waits to escape from this orb. I can feel it.”
	The wielder has likely taken some small steps toward restoring Kalid-Ma to his rightful place, but more can be done. Sometimes the orb quivers as though a creature inside is trying to hatch.
Property: You are immune to psychic damage.
Power (Daily • Necrotic, Psychic): Minor Action. Effect: Each enemy adjacent to you takes 20 necrotic and psychic damage.
Normal (5–11)
“This orb is one of five, and each is more powerful when bound to another.”
	The Orb of Kalid-Ma waits and watches, offering neither positive nor negative feedback.
Unsatisfied (1–4)
“Does anybody else hear that whispering?”
	The orb is openly displeased with its owner. Mental defenses it once provided begin to fade, opening weak spots in the wielder's mind.
Property: You gain vulnerable 5 psychic, and you lose psychic resistance you have from any other source.
Property: Whenever you roll a natural 1 on any attack roll you make using the Orb of Kalid-Ma, you grant combat advantage (save ends).
Angered (0 or Lower)
“It erodes my mind. Soon, nothing will be left of me.”
	The orb knows that its wielder is not going to accomplish what all orbs desire. It actively tries to pass into the hands of another.
Property: You gain vulnerable 10 psychic, and you lose psychic resistance you have from any other source.
Property: Whenever you roll a natural 1 on any attack roll you make using the Orb of Kalid-Ma, you become dazed (save ends).
Moving On
“The orbs seek each other, like kin lost in the desert.”
	An Orb of Kalid-Ma can move on in one of two ways. Either the orb seeks out another who is more willing to reunite the orbs and restore Kalid-Ma, or the wielder melds all five Orbs of Kalid-Ma. In the second case, the shadow-tainted sorcerer-king is reborn in all his magnificence. What he might do with or to his savior is anyone's guess.

Attack: Dexterity vs Reflex.
Special: The pitch cask rarely lands where you want it to. After choosing a target square for the attack, roll 1d8 (for direction) and 1d4-1 (for distance) to see where the pitch cask actually lands. This becomes the origin square for a burst 1 attack. The pitch cask lands 1d4-1 squares to the north on a d8 result of 1, 1d4-1 squares to the northeast on 2, east on 3, southeast on 4, south on 5, southwest on 6, west on 7, and northwest on 8.
Hit: 3d6 fire damage.

It has been suggested that a suit of armor of this sort-which is invariably dented, scarred, and worn, not to mention mismatched after decades of having demolished greaves, gauntlets, and buckles swapped in and out-gains its power by absorbing the endurance of those who have worn it over the ages. Such assertions are untrue but impossible to squelch; the truth is that the enchantments put on these suits can be imbued only in armor that has been well used and even abused.
An adventurer who wears armor of dogged grit is able to keep fighting through nearly any battle, no matter how many of the enemy's blows he or she must endure. The armor appears little better than a run-of-the-mill version ofits kind at turning blows, but the one wearing it can fight on, even after suffering grievous harm, until the battle is won.

No matter what shackles or bindings are used on the wearer of this armor, they are less effective at holding their prey. The obvious way to circumvent this armor-forcibly removing it-is impossible without the wearer's consent (or death).
Stories are still told in Hammerfast's taverns about one famous rogue from recent memory who escaped from the trade guild's dungeon thanks to her armor of escape. After being caught infiltrating the guild's treasury, she bluffed the guards into thinking that she was a spy sent by Mayor Goldspinner to test the treasury's defenses. Before they tried to remove her armor and gear, she convinced the guards to check her story with their captain. By the time they returned, now knowing her lie for what it was, she had made her exit.

No matter what shackles or bindings are used on the wearer of this armor, they are less effective at holding their prey. The obvious way to circumvent this armor-forcibly removing it-is impossible without the wearer's consent (or death).
Stories are still told in Hammerfast's taverns about one famous rogue from recent memory who escaped from the trade guild's dungeon thanks to her armor of escape. After being caught infiltrating the guild's treasury, she bluffed the guards into thinking that she was a spy sent by Mayor Goldspinner to test the treasury's defenses. Before they tried to remove her armor and gear, she convinced the guards to check her story with their captain. By the time they returned, now knowing her lie for what it was, she had made her exit.

This armor was created by an archmage indentured to an ancient king who sought to bedazzle even the gods with the splendor of his personage. It is said that the kingly armor the archmage created for his liege shone as brightly as the sun, and all who saw its brilliance were overcome by the wearer's majesty. The archmage assured his liege that the armor's magic would affect even those ofimmortal-perhaps even deific-power. However, the fact that neither the ancient monarch nor his armor of scintillating colors exists in any other stories suggests that either the enchanter's capabilities were not as great as he believed, or the archmage deliberately overstated the armor's power to rid himself of the megalomaniacal king. Whatever the case, a few powerful archmages have attempted to recreate this armor throughout the centuries, with limited success.

Armor of the charging wind embodies the latter fighting style by drawing on the power of elemental air and fey illusion magic to make its wearer as invisible as the rushing wind.

One ancient tale speaks of an entire army that moved over the land as if it were leaves blown by the wind, appearing suddenly upon the breeze. If the soldiers of such an army were all clad in blendinB armor, it is easy to understand the origin of that story. The colors and textures ofblendinB armor continually blend and swirl to match its surroundings, erupting into a wild cacophony of movement when its wearer is in action and settling into a stable pattern when he or she is at rest. Whether worn by everyone in an army or by an individual, this armor makes it easy for its wearer to move stealthily and remain unnoticed.

It is said that blessed armor ofKord was worn by the deity himself during the war against the primordials. Over time, shards of that suit were scattered to the corners of the planes. A few of the armor's constituent pieces have been discovered in the millennia since those battles of antiquity-a greave, a vambrace, the gorget. Other parts of the original blessed armor ofKord no doubt still rest in ancient tombs and treasure hoards, waiting to be rediscovered. Suits of armor fashioned in recent times sometimes incorporate recovered scraps of the original. Such suits are also referred to as blessed armor ofKord, though they are but pale imitations of the original.
When any component of this suit is incorporated into a suit of ordinary armor, the whole becomes charged with the power of Kord, and its wearer can release discharges of lightning and thunder upon his or her enemies. It is thought that bringing several of the pieces of Kord's original armor together would increase these benefits exponentially, but this act has never been accomplished; some believe that the dissolution of the armor is Kord's will, and that to reunite the pieces would invite the god's disfavor.

This strange armor has been mentioned in many tomes containing lore about enchanted items. Although every account describes each suit of doppelaanaer armor as having similar capabilities, no two of these accounts agree on the armor's physical characteristics.
Doppelaanaer armor's strange power is its ability to take on the protective properties of the armor being worn by its wearer's opponent. It can absorb and exhibit the qualities of plate mail, a shield, or even the magical protections placed on enchanted armor. All scholarly sources agree, however, that each wearer can claim the protective benefits of an opponent's defenses only while that opponent lives and fights, since the armor's magic draws upon the foe's skill and abilities as well as its defenses.

Doppelaanaer armor's strange power is its ability to take on the protective properties of the armor being worn by its wearer's opponent. It can absorb and exhibit the qualities of plate mail, a shield, or even the magical protections placed on enchanted armor. All scholarly sources agree, however, that each wearer can claim the protective benefits of an opponent's defenses only while that opponent lives and fights, since the armor's magic draws upon the foe's skill and abilities as well as its defenses.

The armor worn by the living dead slowly becomes imbued with shadow magic. When a death knight, a Wight, or some similar horror is defeated, a skilled wizard can preserve the magic bound within the armor before it dissipates. Imbued with the power of the grave, ebon armor allows its wearer to siphon life energy from dying foes.

Some suits are also enchanted to dampen sounds the wearer makes, and at least one rumor tells of a suit of this armor that can project a silence effect out a short distance to those around it. Although some sages think it's possible to create gloaming armor out of sturdier materials, the only known examples of the enchantment have been placed on less noisy types of armor such as cloth, leather, and hide.

Many believe that a paranoid crafter enchanted the first suit of greater armor of eyes. The armor's effect is Simple: It allows the one wearing it to see in all directions at once. It is impossible to gain any advantage against someone wearing this armor by attacking him or her from behind or from an unnoticed position, and avoiding the wearer's notice is difficult. There are dangers to such protection, however, because it is thought that the paranoiac who enchanted the original armor died in a particularly poetic fashion from the gaze of a basilisk.

The material that makes up this strange suit of armor seems normal at first glance. Closer inspection reveals that the armor's weave is crafted from thousands of inch-long worm castings, pressed and woven together. The nature of the maggot-sized worms used in this way has been lost to history, but they must not have been mundane creatures; else why use such minute elements to construct a suit of armor?
Someone wearing hide of worms armor can pass safely through soil and dirt, carrying along anything else worn or held. The chronicles of a certain notorious bandit king of antiquity whose signature accoutrement was his hide of worms are rife with accounts of him enticing enemies to follow him beneath the ground, eventually submerging them entirely and leaving them to die, buried alive. Such tales are probably overstated.

Plate mail of etherealness offers nearly flawless magical protection and grants its wearer superior mobility on the battlefield.

Shallow wave armor is noteworthy for the dust and grime that is forever embedded in its padding, greaves, and joints. Although this armor looks dingy, its attunement to the grave lends it a potent magical ability. Part of the process of creating this armor requires it to be buried in a grave for a year and a day. That attunement to the grave provides it with a powerful ward against harm. If a person clad in shallow wave armor suffers a deadly wound, the armor's magic surges to provide a corresponding burst of healing.

This white armor is designed for use in climates where frigid temperatures and bitter winds freeze the flesh and steal the very life of those with warm blood in their veins. Wintersnap armor protects its wearer from cold temperatures and cruel winds. Further, the white-colored material it is constructed from conceals its wearer with supernatural potency while on snow and ice.
The material from which wintersnap armor is made seems immediately obvious to those who see it from a distance-surely came from a great polar bear, or a furred cold drake, or an albino seal-but upon closer examination of its texture and sheen, all of these possibilities are discarded, because the nature of its crafting is mystifying. The most common theory suggests that the material comes from the pelt of a unique creature known as the White One, who is eternally bound in a secret place within the ice. It is thought that this creature's fortitude is so great that it can survive being flayed and eventually produces a new skin that can be shaped into this armor.

This white armor is designed for use in climates where frigid temperatures and bitter winds freeze the flesh and steal the very life of those with warm blood in their veins. Wintersnap armor protects its wearer from cold temperatures and cruel winds. Further, the white-colored material it is constructed from conceals its wearer with supernatural potency while on snow and ice.
The material from which wintersnap armor is made seems immediately obvious to those who see it from a distance-surely came from a great polar bear, or a furred cold drake, or an albino seal-but upon closer examination of its texture and sheen, all of these possibilities are discarded, because the nature of its crafting is mystifying. The most common theory suggests that the material comes from the pelt of a unique creature known as the White One, who is eternally bound in a secret place within the ice. It is thought that this creature's fortitude is so great that it can survive being flayed and eventually produces a new skin that can be shaped into this armor.

    Description: Banded mail consists of a suit of chainmail reinforced with layers of metal plates arranged in strips along the suit's midsection. Banded mail offers the same level of protection as chainmail while proving lighter and more flexible. A warrior in banded mail moves as quickly as one in leather armor.
    To gain the use of and become proficient with Banded Mail, the Armor Proficiency Banded Mail feat is required.

    Metal rings woven together into a shirt, leggings, and a hood make up a suit of chainmail. Chainmail grants good protection, but it's cumbersome, so it reduces your mobility and agility.

    Description: First developed by the dwarves, splint mail consists of vertical strips of metal bound to a thick layer of leather and chainmail. Because it is so heavy and ponderous, few other than dwarves wear it in battle. While it lacks the protective elements of plate, it is scale armor's equal. More important, its rigid construction allows it to absorb some portion of an enemy's blows.
    To gain the use of and become proficient with Splint Mail, the Armor Proficiency Splint Mail feat is required.
    Properties:
    Durable 3 (The first time you take damage during an encounter, reduce that damage by an amount equal to the armor's durability rating. The armor then loses this property until you repair it during a short rest or an extended rest. Durable armor provides greater damage absorption when it is enchanted. Add the enhancement bonus of the armor to the durability rating of light armor, and add twice the enhancement bonus to the durability rating of heavy armor.)

    Overlapping pieces of highly durable material, such as steel or even dragon scales, make up scale armor. Despite its heaviness, scale is surprisingly easy to wear; its straps and buckles make it adjustable and able to fit snugly on the body, allowing for flexibility and agility.

    Description: Although a shield is usually a defensive item, a barbed shield turns the tables on attackers because of the long spikes and blades attached to it. While too awkward to use as a weapon, a barbed shield provides added protection against enemies that attempt to grab you, because the spikes and barbs built into it cut into them.

Legend has it that this tome is the spellbook of the goddess Ioun, dropped from the heavens into the world, and that it is the source of all arcane knowledge. Others say Vecna used the Book of Infinite Spells as his spellbook during his lifetime, and that he knows how any spell cast from it is used. Perhaps both bits oflore are true.
The Book of Infinite Spells is a hefty tome that shows signs of its great age. Scars of battle mar its weatherbeaten cover, and the edges of its yellowed pages are blotched with every sort of stain from blood to wine to strange reagents. Yet no wound can ever do great harm to the book, and nothing can obscure the arcane scribbles and runes that describe its spells. Liquids spilled upon the pages bead and slide away from words and diagrams toward the margins. Anything written in the book vanishes unless it pertains to the spells inside. Fire cannot harm it, nor can even the mightiest titan tear out its pages.
The volume's original title, if it had one, is long lost to antiquity. The name it is known by today, Book of Infinite Spells, is seemingly not a misnomer: Even a newly created piece of wizardly magic appears instantly in the book, its ink still slightly moist as if the spell had been penned just an hour before. What many-including wizards-don't know is that the book proves powerful in anyone's hands, allowing whoever studies it to cast spells.

This enormous book, the size of a small table, seems fit more for the hands of gods than mortals. Its obsidian covers enclose pages made from thin sheets of dull gray metal. Embossed upon or etched into the surface of every page are images both beautiful and horrific, and words in languages both rare and unknown. No matter how many pages its owner turns, another and another still remains, because the number of scenes that the book can depict from throughout the multiverse is truly without limit.
The origin of the Codex of the Infinite Planes seems to be somehow entwined with the formation of the planes themselves. Certainly the book contains writing that cannot now be deciphered, but particular symbols in the book use the language of creation those mysterious figures that runepriests now use to make their magic. Regardless of its origin, the codex appears in legend as an object upon which empires are founded and one that brings them to utter ruin. Its powers seem to shift each time it comes to the fore in history, but it is said to have been used in eons past to transport whole armies from one plane to another. At one point a careless or inept user ended up bringing Garniax, the Indestructible Fiend, into the world whereupon the codex had to be used again to send the demon back to the Abyss.

The Hammer of Thunderbolts has found its way into many hands over the millennia of its existence. Many dwarves believe that Moradin crafted the Hammer as his original weapon of choice. Yet the legends of most other races attribute the artifact to the ambition of Kord, who gained his power over storms by slaying a primordial of tempests. According to such stories, the Hammer is the primordial's heart, ripped free from its body and twisted into its present shape by Kord's bare hands.
If Moradin or Kord did create the Hammer of Thunderbolts, neither seems to miss it. Instead, the weapon has cascaded through history from the possession of one great hero or villain to the next. Though it is certainly a weapon of nearly inestimable value in melee, the true power of the hammer manifests only when it is hurled at foes. Then the roar of the storm echoes about it, and some of these throws culminate in a radiating wave of thunder that flattens every creature nearby.

Jacinth of Inestimable Beauty Lore
A famous eladrin heirloom, the Jacinth of Inestimable Beauty is a large orange jewel cut in the shape of a flower and mounted in a brooch of gold.
Long ago, an eladrin master jewelsmith named Immeral Silverleaf invented a way to use high elven magic to enhance the beauty and durability of natural gemstones. The magic gems he created were the wonder of the realm, and with each one he made, his skill and confidence grew. One day the dwarves of a neighboring realm unearthed a striking gemstone of perfect orange corundum a blazing sapphire the color of fire. Immeral acquired the great gemstone from the dwarves in exchange for lavish gifts of his earlier work and promises of more to come, and then set about the task of creating his masterwork. Utterly devoted to his queen, he crafted a piece for her that would capture and reflect her beauty forever, which he dubbed the Jacinth of Inestimable Beauty.
When the eladrin queen donned Immeral's jewel, all who stood before her fell under the influence of her beauty. Her realm flourished for many years, and she was famed far and wide for the aid and comfort that she provided for her subjects through the power of the artifact. Yet finally the long golden afternoon of her realm faded into dusk; her enemies grew strong, and the untold value of the jewel incited avarice in the hearts of the wicked. One dark day the queen was murdered by her husband, who was half-mad with jealousy because of the love so many nobles and courtiers held for his queen. The prince-consort was put to death, but the deed was done. The jacinth was sequestered away in the royal vaults, only to disappear when evil forces sacked the kingdom a few years later. As for Immeral, he never made another jewel after the jacinth.
Since the days of the ancient eladrin kingdoms, the jacinth has appeared now and again in the possession of a series of monarchs. It is associated with gracefulness, justice, and prosperity ... but also with vanity and avarice. Any monarch in the world would be strengthened by mere possession of the jacinth, and yet all too often the owners who have come after the queen have become obsessed with continuing to add to their own splendor, seeking to gain ever more objects of art and other items treasured for their beauty. Scholars speculate that the jacinth began planting this objective in the minds of its owners after leaving the queen's care. It prompts this greedy behavior in them precisely for the reason of making them vulnerable to others who envy their exquisite treasures. In such a way do these items of utmost value change hands from time to time, perhaps destined to land ultimately in the possession of a great ruler whose appreciation of their beauty knows no bounds, and whose ability to hold onto them despite threats is just as great. So it is with the jacinth itself, which is said to gravitate from owner to owner in a search for one who can truly replace the queen.

Made from strands of congealed shadow, the Shadowstaff is the handiwork of a long-dead shadar-kai warlock prince named Amarethydd. One of the most powerful of his race, he is said to have entered into a pact with the very essence of shadow in order to forge a suitable implement for himself.
Armed with the Shadowstaff, Amarethydd ruled over his people for centuries and exacted tribute from many realms. But in time, the deadly ennui that afflicts the shadar-kai overcame Amarethydd as well, and he faded away after bequeathing his staff to his foremost apprentice. That young individual was soon killed by her rivaIs,' and various shadar-kai wizards and warlocks murdered each other over the staff for many years before a band of human adventurers carried it back to the mortal world-where it has again changed hands several times.
The infamous wizard Evard is the last known owner of the Shadowstaff He seems to have been parted from it under mysterious circumstances, and who or what owns the Shadowstaff now is a matter of speculation. Some believe that the staff abandoned Evard, and that the wizard is looking for the artifact and will deal harshly with anyone who tries to keep it from him. Others say that Evard bargained away the Shadowstaff to a powerful drow prince, who intends to use the device to further his evil designs against the surface world.

The paladin Prator was a mighty hero of old, famed as a slayer of evil dragons and a champion of justice. The shield he carried through his many battles is imbued with the memory of his courage and selflessness. Prator fell during a desperate fight in Minauros, third of the Nine Hells, and his famous shield disappeared for many years, presumably taken as a trophy by some archdevil or pit fiend. About two centuries ago, the Shield ofPrator turned up in the clutches of a githyanki pirate defeated by a band of mortal heroes. In the time since, it has been reported in the hands of a different hero or villain every few years.
From tales of its ancient history, the shield is renowned as a formidable defense against the threat of evil. In point of practical application, its powers and properties are equally effective against enemies of any alignment. As with almost all enchanted items, how the Shield of Prator is used depends greatly on the mind set and desires of its current owner.

Zax, Cloak of Kings Lore
The Cloak of Kings looks spun entirely from gold, and its hem and edges glitter with gemstones. It would be counted among the most beautiful objects in the world even without its intricate embroidery that depicts scenes of great castles in settings of natural beauty, and crowned and enthroned figures seated before their bowing subjects.
The origin of the cloak is shrouded in conflicting claims. Dwarf scholars say that only one of their race could have spun the gold so finely. Elven legends tell of a star that fell from the sky, leaving a crater in which the cloak was found. Humans attribute its creation to various deities, including Erathis and Pelor.
Regardless ofits history, the Cloak of Kings has become a dynastic relic to several empires. It has served a host of kings, empresses, dukes, marchionesses, and others ofless noble title. Wars have been fought over its possession, and legends formed about those who sought and won it from great dangers.
The cloak knows itself as Zax, a garment of great power that deigns itself to be worn by someone of equally great importance. When worn by a leader, Zax communicates mentally to help settle disputes, warn of danger, and educate its wearer on the exploits of earlier rulers who bore the cloak.

The Deck of Many Things holds within it the potential for both great ruin and great reward. Though its true origins have been lost to the ages, many historians believe that the artifact was originally a gift from a powerful and ancient archfey to a long-forgotten emperor. The archfey knew that the emperor was extremely superstitious and could not resist reading his own fortunes within the cards. The Deck of Many Things might be responsible for shattering that ancient empire and giving rise to powerful warlords that vied for control of its remnants.
	The Deck passes from hand to hand, bringing low the mighty and elevating the meek (or the other way around). While each of its cards grants its user certain powers, when the twenty-two cards are brought together, the complete Deck is an artifact implement that imbues its possessor with many benefits.
Goals of the Deck of Many Things
	♦ Sow chaos and discord throughout the world.
	♦ Be present at events of great importance, and then add a chaotic element to the proceedings of those events to alter everyone's fortunes.
	♦ Topple powerful leaders (good or evil) and cause farreaching organizations to crumble.
Roleplaying the Deck of Many Things
The Deck of Many Things is an agent of chaos that does its work subtly, through those who possess it. The Deck wants to use its owner as its agent, making temptation its greatest weapon. Whenever the owner is contemplating a risky action, it might try to tempt that character with the suggestion that taking the risk would be a good idea—even if the chances of success are slim.
	The Deck never communicates overtly, but occasionally the top card might f lip over on its own to reveal whether the artifact is pleased or displeased (this action does not trigger the Deck's drawn card effect).
	Additionally, while the owner is holding the Deck, that character occasionally sees visions of multiple possible outcomes of any given action, showing the way luck will affect the outcome.
Concordance
An artifact's concordance score measures its attitude toward its owner. The Deck of Many Things starts with a concordance of 5 when an adventurer takes possession of it, with a likely modifier of +5 because the adventurers have just reassembled its scattered cards. Various actions and events increase or decrease its concordance as long as the adventurer possesses the Deck. When the artifact is pleased with its owner's actions, its concordance goes up. When the owner acts contrary to the Deck's desires, its concordance decreases.
	The Deck's concordance determines its general attitude toward the owner, from angered (concordance 0 or lower) to pleased (concordance 16 or higher). Its attitude, in turn, determines some of its properties and powers, as described below.
	The owner knows of the factors that alter the Deck's concordance—it's in the artifact's best interests to communicate its desires and expectations. But keep the Deck's actual concordance score a secret, telling the player only if its powers or properties change. The player shouldn't ever know exactly how close the artifact is to changing its attitude.
DECK OF MANY THINGS CONCORDANCE
&lt;table&gt;Starting score	5
Owner has reassembled the cards of the Deck	+5
Owner gains a level	+1d10
Owner is unaligned	+1
Owner has the fey origin	+1
Owner is reduced to 0 hit points	+1
Owner overthrows a ruler or powerful leader	+2
Owner obtains a magic item	-1
Owner goes a day without using an arcane power	-1&lt;/table&gt;
Pleased (16–20)
“Hmm, seems like the cards are falling in my favor these days.”
When the owner has finally done the Deck's bidding, or enough of it anyway, the Deck gives the owner the chance to draw from it with better-than-average odds of avoiding the more ruinous cards.
	Property: Any time you roll a result of 1 on any die, reroll that die until you roll a result other than 1.
	Power (Daily): Standard Action. You draw three cards from the Deck of Many Things and then choose any one card you drew, resolving the effect of that card as described below. The Deck then vanishes and is lost (see “Moving On,” below).
Satisfied (12–15)
“There's wisdom in the cards, if only you could see it.”
The Deck is pleased with the chaos that the owner is sowing, and begins trying to tempt that character into drawing from it by sweetening the deal.
	Property: Any time you roll a result of 1 on any die (except a d20), reroll that die until you roll a result other than 1.
	Power (Daily): Standard Action. You draw two cards from the Deck of Many Things and then choose any one card you drew, resolving the effect of that card as described below. The Deck then vanishes and is lost (see “Moving On,” below).
Normal (5–11)
“Curious—the cards show me how big a role luck plays in our lives.”
When first drawn from its container, the Deck conveys little more than a sense that much in the world is a matter of luck and not skill.
	Power (Daily): Standard Action. You draw a card from the Deck of Many Things and then resolve the effect of that card as described below. The Deck then vanishes and is lost (see “Moving On,” below).
Unsatisfied (1–4)
“I'm afraid that this might not be a lucky time for me.”
An owner who rejects the Deck's desires soon experiences a streak of bad, if harmless, luck. The bad luck is an inconvenience for now, but the Deck wants to make sure the owner knows it is displeased.
	Property: Any time you roll the maximum result on a die (except a d20), treat the result as a 1 instead.
	Power (Daily): Standard Action. You draw two cards from the Deck of Many Things and then choose any one card you drew. You must choose a card with the Ruin descriptor, if one was drawn. Resolve the effect of the chosen card, as described below. The Deck then vanishes and is lost (see “Moving On,” below).
Angered (0 or Lower)
“The Deck shows me dark portents; my future is looking grim.”
An angered Deck of Many Things can be a dangerous item indeed. Anyone drawing from the Deck at this point is extremely likely to suffer ill luck.
	Property: Any time you roll the maximum result on a die, treat the result as a 1 instead.
	Power (Daily): Standard Action. You draw three cards from the Deck of Many Things and then choose any one card you drew. You must choose a card with the Ruin descriptor, if one was drawn. Resolve the effect of the chosen card, as described below. The Deck then vanishes and is lost (see “Moving On,” below).
Moving On
“It's gone! Vanished into thin air!”
The Deck of Many Things fades in and out of history, wreaking havoc and upsetting the order of things from time to time. It is an agent of chaos in an otherwise ordered world, and once someone has drawn from the complete Deck it vanishes, never to be seen again by that person.
The Complete Deck
Each card drawn from the complete Deck of Many Things has a special effect that triggers when it is drawn. Though the concordance score of the artifact determines how many cards are drawn, only one card is triggered each draw. The effect of the drawn card is described below. (Drawing a card from an incomplete Deck has a lesser effect, as described in “Card Effects” on page 23.)
	Eleven of the cards have the Ruin descriptor. This helps determine which card's effect comes into play when the Deck of Many Things is unsatisfied or angered. Cards with a generally beneficial effect have the Reward descriptor, which does not affect card draws.
Balance
Ruin
You have been judged—and found wanting. You gain one of the following two minor quests, depending on your alignment. If you are unaligned, you may choose either.
If you are good or lawful good, you gain the following quest.
Minor Quest: A Walk on the Dark Side
To be truly a model for good, you must experience evil first hand. You must slay or otherwise bring ruin to a specific good or lawful good creature (chosen by the Dungeon Master) of level 11.
	Reward: 600 XP, and you can choose to change your alignment to unaligned or evil.
If you are evil or chaotic evil, you gain the following quest.
Minor Quest: A Shot at Redemption
None are so vile that they cannot earn redemption if their desire is true. You must pledge yourself to the service of a powerful good or lawful good creature (chosen by the Dungeon Master) of level 11, and convince it to grant you spiritual clemency by performing a task it assigns.
	Reward: 600 XP, and you can choose to change your alignment to unaligned or good.
Comet
Reward
Double the XP award for the next major quest the party completes.
Donjon
Ruin
You are imprisoned by magic—which leaves you in a state of dreamless sleep—deep beneath the earth. Though your body vanishes, your magic items and other gear remain behind. The party gains the following major quest.
Major Quest: Prison of the Donjon
The adventurers must find the location of your imprisonment. The prison is deep beneath the earth (possibly within a dungeon, or in a drow citadel in the Underdark). The adventurers must journey to that location, find your imprisoned body, and use the holy cleansing power (FL 92) or the Remove Affliction ritual (Player's Handbook 311) to free you from the prison.
	Reward: 600 XP per adventurer.
Euryale
Ruin
You take a -3 penalty to saving throws. Only the holy cleansing power (FL 92) or the Remove Aff liction ritual (Player's Handbook 311) can remove this effect, and you cannot undergo this cleansing until you first roll a natural 20 on a saving throw.
Fates
Reward
You gain the shelter of fate legendary boon.
Flames
Ruin
You earn the enmity of a powerful being from another plane, gaining the following minor quest.
Minor Quest: Enmity of Flames
You must defeat the creature that has sworn enmity against you, which has vowed to slay you or plague your life. The enemy is chosen by the Dungeon Master and can be any 11th-level creature from another plane that is not an elite, solo, or minion, such as a gargoyle rock hurler or a chain devil.
	Reward: 600 XP.
Fool
Ruin
Any time the Fool is drawn, before any choices are made you discard the Fool and draw a card off the top of the Deck of Many Things until you draw a card with the Ruin descriptor. Keep only the last card drawn, then make any choices you are allowed.
Gem
Reward
You gain 9,000 gp worth of gold and gems.
Idiot
Ruin
You take a -2 penalty to Intelligence checks and Intelligence-based attack rolls and skill checks. Only the holy cleansing power (FL 92) or the Remove Affliction ritual (Player's Handbook 311) can remove this effect, and you cannot undergo this cleansing until you roll a natural 20 on an Intelligence-based attack roll or skill check.
	Once this effect begins, you draw another card and gain its effect.
Jester
Reward
Draw two more cards from the Deck of Many Things. If either of them has the Ruin descriptor, that card replaces the Jester as your chosen card (if both do, you must select one of those two cards). Otherwise, you can choose any other card from this draw (including the two you just drew) to replace the Jester as your chosen card.
Key
Reward
You gain a magic weapon of your choice, which must be of level 11 or lower.
Knight
Reward
You gain the service of a human duelist. The duelist has 70 hit points and 10 healing surges but is otherwise identical to that presented in Monster Vault (page 173). This duelist is summoned from elsewhere in the world, appears instantaneously, and knows that it has been summoned by powerful forces to aid you.
Moon
Reward
When you draw the Moon card, you can choose one of the following effects.
	♦ One dead creature that has been dead no more than 30 days returns to life.
	♦ One effect or affliction (such as a lingering curse, a disease, petrification, or the harmful effects of Ruin cards) immediately ends.
	♦ You and your allies are immediately transported to a location you know well.
	♦ You duplicate the effect of any utility power of level 10 or lower.
Rogue
Ruin
You earn the secret enmity of a nonplayer character—perhaps one who accompanies your party, or a community or religious leader, chosen by the Dungeon Master. You do not know the identity of the person who holds this enmity toward you, since it is secret, but you do gain the following quest.
Minor Quest: Rogue's Curse
You must discover the person who has been turned against you by the Deck of Many Things, then either defeat or successfully persuade that person to cease his or her enmity toward you.
	Reward: 600 XP.
Ruin
Ruin
Each of your magic items turns into residuum worth 80 percent of its normal value.
Skull
Ruin
Four wraiths (MV 284), a mad wraith (MV 286), and three sovereign wraiths (MV 287) appear and attack you and your allies immediately.
Star
Reward
You gain the mark of the star legendary boon.
Sun
Reward
You gain a wondrous item of your choice, which must be of level 10 or lower.
Talons
Ruin
You cannot use magic item at-will, encounter, or daily powers. Only the holy cleansing power (FL 92) or the Remove Affliction ritual (Player's Handbook 311) can remove this effect, and you cannot undergo this cleansing until you have given away a magic item of your level or higher.
Throne
Reward
Your party gains the following major quest.
Major Quest: What's Rightfully Yours
The adventurers have been rewarded with a keep somewhere in the world to claim as their home. However, the keep is currently in the hands of other creatures. The adventurers must go to the keep and claim it as their own, ousting those that currently inhabit it.
	Reward: 600 XP per adventurer.
Vizier
Reward
You gain the vision of the vizier legendary boon.
Void
Ruin
You fall unconscious and cannot be awakened. The party gains the following major quest.
Major Quest: Recovering the Prison
The adventurers must find the object in which your psyche is imprisoned. The prison is on another plane, and the adventurers must journey to that plane, find the object containing your psyche and recover it, and then break the object to release your psyche. Once the prison object is broken, you are no longer unconscious.
	Reward: 600 XP per adventurer.

		<specific name="Full Text"> Kusari-gama
Superior double melee weapon
Cost: 10 gp
Damage: 1d10
Proficient: +2
Range: -
Weight: 3 lb.
Originally a tool used by farmers and peasants to tend crops and for a variety of other mundane uses, the kusari-gama was adopted as a weapon by the ninja because of both its flexibility and its ability to pass unnoticed as a common item.
This weapon features a sickle (or kama) on one end of a chain and a heavy weight on the other, with the weight swung with great force and used to either entangle or trip a foe, and the kama used to slice at a vital part of the body.
Properties:
Defensive (A defensive weapon grants you a +1 bonus to AC while you wield the defensive weapon in one hand and wield another melee weapon in your other hand. Wielding more than one defensive weapon does not increase this bonus. To gain this benefit, you need not attack with the defensive weapon, but you must be proficient with it.).
Reach (With a reach weapon, you can attack enemies that are 2 squares away from you as well as adjacent enemies, with no attack penalty. You can still make opportunity attacks only against adjacent enemies. Likewise, you can flank only an adjacent enemy.).
Group:
Flail (Weapons in the flail group have a flexible material, usually a length of chain, between a solid handle and the damage-dealing end of the weapon.). </specific>

Properties:
Off-Hand (An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can't attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.).

Effect: You pass the quill over an amount of text or an illustration equivalent to a single parchment page. The image or text is magically recorded within the quill for later reproduction. Recording another page with the quill erases the page already recorded. </specific>

Effect: You point the quill at a sheet of parchment or paper and mentally command it to reproduce the illustration or text recorded within it. No matter what the medium of the original (charcoal on paper, runes scribed in stone, and so on), the reproduction is rendered in normal ink. The reproduction created by the qUill is identical in appearance to the original, but the quill cannot record magical properties. For example, you cannot perform a ritual from a ritual scroll recorded and reproduced by the quill, nor can the quill copy powers or rituals from a wizard's spellbook. </specific>

When the hole is picked up from the surface, the entrance disappears and anything inside the space remains there. The hole cannot be closed if any creatures are within it. The items that can be placed within the portable hole are limited only by volume-up to a maximum of 6 feet by 6 feet by 10 feet-not by weight. </specific>

Effect: By touching one sword of Tyr to another and uttering a command word, a bonded wielder of both weapons can meld them into a single item. When this happens, the bonded wielder chooses the new item's form (which must be the same as one of the two melding weapons) and which weapon's magical properties and powers are carried over to the new item. Any daily powers expended on one of the melding weapons are expended on the new weapon. The new item's enhancement bonus is equal to the greater enhancement bonus of the two melding weapons. The bonded wielder can end this effect and separate the swords as a minor action. </specific>

Superior double melee weapon
Cost: 10 gp
Damage: 1d12
Proficient: +2
Range: -
Weight: 6 lb.
Originally a tool used by farmers and peasants to tend crops and for a variety of other mundane uses, the kusari-gama was adopted as a weapon by the ninja because of both its flexibility and its ability to pass unnoticed as a common item.
This weapon features a sickle (or kama) on one end of a chain and a heavy weight on the other, with the weight swung with great force and used to either entangle or trip a foe, and the kama used to slice at a vital part of the body.
Properties:
Defensive (A defensive weapon grants you a +1 bonus to AC while you wield the defensive weapon in one hand and wield another melee weapon in your other hand. Wielding more than one defensive weapon does not increase this bonus. To gain this benefit, you need not attack with the defensive weapon, but you must be proficient with it.).
Reach (With a reach weapon, you can attack enemies that are 2 squares away from you as well as adjacent enemies, with no attack penalty. You can still make opportunity attacks only against adjacent enemies. Likewise, you can flank only an adjacent enemy.).
Group:
Flail (Weapons in the flail group have a flexible material, usually a length of chain, between a solid handle and the damage-dealing end of the weapon.). </specific>

Rangers of the Silver Hart who perform an act of notable valor or render a great service to the realm are often rewarded with the presentation of a silver hart clasp-a brooch that serves as an emblem of the order and a badge of authority respected throughout Cernall. Traditionally, the silver hart clasp is awarded personally by the reigning marchion in a private ceremony.

Attack: Ranged unlimited on the same plane (the crown's wearer); your level + 3 vs. Will
Hit: You impart an emotion or an idea to the wearer. The emotion can have an image attached (such as of a particular person, a type of creature, an item, or a place), and the idea (whether true or false) must be expressed as a single sentence in a language understood by the wearer. This power is most effective when the wearer is praying or asleep and dreaming. The wearer typically believes that the idea or statement was imparted by a deity, an ancestor, a haunting, or its own subconscious. Regardless, the crown of eyes does not control the decisions or actions of the wearer, who is free to respond as desired. </specific>

		<specific name="Tier"> Heroic </specific>
		<specific name="Lore"> Slaads are known for their imposing presence and their unpredictability, yet the legendary Xenda-Dran struck fear into even the mightiest of his kindred. Sages say that during Dran's metamorphosis into what should have been a green slaad, he instead became something else, a creature that drew power from both chaos and shadow. This new Dran was quickly recruited to the service of the slaad Ygorl, Lord of Entropy, as a sorcerous assassin.
Few killers have shed more blood across the worlds than Xenda-Dran. The slaad took great pleasure in assassinating powerful enemies, and with each slaying his powers grew stronger. The mightiest denizens of the Elemental Chaos found their existences cut short as they were strangled by their own shadows or saw their own flesh stripped from their bones by discordant energies.
Xenda-Dran began to collect trophies from his greatest kills, and he enchanted them into armaments that made him even more formidable.
* From the hands of a rival assassin, the babau Timmevinc, the slaad crafted grisly gauntlets that channeled the demon's corrosive power.
* When Dran defeated a pack of ice devils bent on Ygorl's death in the middle of a deadly storm, he claimed the leader's horn for a special focus.
* The hides of sixty-six different elemental denizens were sewn into his cloak, including the skins of slaad warriors, the scales of demons, and the preserved flesh of myriad archons.

* Promote honor, justice, and freedom.
* Oppose the machinations of Tiamat, her followers, and those who oppress others to further their greed.
* Root out evildoers, destroy them, and expose their plans.
Roleplaying Justice's Edge
Justice's Edge is direct with its thoughts and opinions. It communicates telepathically with its wielder, but usually does so only when it is displeased. If the wielder fails to seek justice against those who have done evil, the sword speaks up in commanding and uncompromising tones.
CONCORDANCE
&lt;table&gt;Starting score	5
Owner gains a level	+1d6
Owner actively worships Bahamut	+4
Owner furthers a just cause (1/level)	+1
Owner fails to seek justice (1/day)	-2
Owner performs an evil act	-4&lt;/table&gt;
Pleased (16-20)
"Justice's Edge feels the eternal flame of justice burning in its wielder. The blade transforms this connection between it and the wielder into holy power."
	The sword's enhancement bonus becomes +6, and its wielder gains the use of strip the wicked as long as Justice's Edge remains pleased.
Strip the Wicked (Daily): No Action.
	Trigger: You use Justice’s Edge to hit a target with a melee attack.
	Effect: Until the end of your next turn, the target loses all immunities and resistances.	
Satisfied (12-15)
"Justice's Edge feels a kinship with its wielder, offering a small benefit as an encouragement for further acts of valor and bravery."
	The wielder gains the use of a new property as long as Justice's Edge remains satisfied or pleased.
Property: You gain a +2 power bonus to saving throws while you are adjacent to an evil creature.
Normal (5-11)
"Justice's Edge recognizes in its wielder the potential to become a bastion of virtue, bravery, and fairness."
	At this concordance, the blade has the properties, powers, and characteristics included in its description.
Unsatisfied (1-4)
Justice's Edge is disappointed in the acts of its wielder, who has performed in a manner inconsistent with the blade's dedication to fighting injustice and battling evil at all costs.
	The sword's enhancement bonus becomes +4, and its properties and powers fail to function.
Angered (0 or lower)
Justice's Edge is unforgiving in the face of mortal weakness. The moment a wielder does enough to anger the sword, by failing to strike out against evil or injustice, Justice's Edge disappears, seeking a more worthy champion.
	The sword of Bahamut offers no second chances or long goodbyes. It might call forth servants of Bahamut to punish a wicked former wielder.
Moving On
Justice's Edge might abandon its wielder not out of anger but out of respect. If the sword recognizes that its wielder has become the epitome of the ethos of the Platinum Dragon, and that its own abilities are now needed to help guide a lesser hero, then the next time the wielder gains a level, the sword and scabbard vanish in a flash of platinum-white light, appearing somewhere else in the world where a champion requires a weapon in the fight against injustice and evil.

All agree that fire was the first element to be distilled into a pure essence whose destructive energy could be safely contained.  Some say Vol Tomo created alchemist's fire to give common people a weapon against the young empire of Bael Turath, and that the tieflings' rise to imperial power was hastened because only they could survive when peasants threw a flask of the fiery stuff through a noble's carriage window.  The variant essences that were later developed are often called alchemist's frost, alchemist's acid, alchemist's spark, and alchemist's venom.

The utility of this alchemical item is limited only by the valume of the shape it can be used to simulate.  Some people have tried to combine multiple batches of foaming plaster in an attempt to capture an impression of an exceedingly large object (such as a bas relief carved into a wall).  The problem they encountered was that as the amount of each reagent is increased, the length of time the plaster stays wet decreases.  Whoever came up with the original formula seems to have found the right balance between the volume of the plaster and how long it remains malleable.

Effect: You mix the plaster.  Once before the end of the encounter, you can use a minor action to create an impression in the wet plaster of a footprint, a key, or a similar small object.  Giving the hardened plaster to someone else allows that person to identify the footprint, duplicate the key, and so on as if he or she had the original item.
  If the plaster is not used by the end of the encounter, it hardens into a lump.	</specific>

GOALS OF THE CROWN
The Crown of Whispers is a part of Daskinor's own mind, but it was separated and given its independence long ago. Independence means nothing to the crown, though. Instead, it craves the relationship it once had with its first owner. As a result, the Crown of Whispers is possessed of a singular purpose: to become inexorably intertwined with the psyche of Daskinor once more.
	Though the crown was formed with the aid of the mind of the sorcerer-king of Eldaarich, only will drives it, not true intelligence. The crown acts using manipulation tactics that its original owner used to great effect and does not possess any logical, reasoning sentience to form new tactics of its own. As it gains familiarity with its current wearer, its knowledge of the wearer's thoughts allows it to prey upon the wearer's fears and more effectively manipulate its current owner. Its goals are as follows.
* To return to Eldaarich and rest upon the brow of the mad king Daskinor.
* To be worn by individuals whom it can manipulate into moving it closer to its destination.
* To protect itself from dangers, both real and imaginary, by making its owners as "vigilant" as Daskinor.
ROLEPLAYING THE CROWN OF WHISPERS
The Crown of Whispers is a psionic force that embodies the traits of insidious paranoia and manipulation, and it has a desire to be reunited with Daskinor. At first, it provides nothing but benefits to its owner. Once the crown has worked its way into the mind of its host and made the host dependent on its abilities, the crown begins nudging its owner toward the citystate of Eldaarich. This drive manifests in the form of enticement (offering greater rewards for doing as the crown wants) and punishment (denying something essential to the owner until the Crown of Whispers gets what it wants).
	The primary way the crown communicates with its owner is through a chorus of whispering voices that only the wearer can hear. When the crown is first placed upon the wearer's head, these whispers are muted, manifesting only as the brief sound of a wind blowing across a sand dune. As time passes, the crown grows bolder and more skilled at communication with its current wearer, and the whispers grow louder and clearer. After a prolonged period of use by one wearer, the whispers manifested by the artifact form a synchronous chorus that acts as an invisible advisor to that individual, as if a vizier stood just at the shoulder of the wearer.
CONCORDANCE
The concordance of the Crown of Whispers represents how well the crown believes that the owner is serving it in leading it back to Eldaarich and Daskinor. As the owner brings the crown closer to its goal, the artifact grows more pleased. Such pleasure is expressed not only by further reward, but also by the growing activity of the crown in the mind of its host. As the concordance increases, so too does the clarity of the whispers in the mind of the host. The crown begins offering advice that sounds like wisdom but slowly turns the wearer more paranoid. Any attempt to thwart the crown's goals displeases it, and its whispers in the mind of its host crescendo into a maddening cacophony.
&lt;table&gt;Starting score	5
Owner gains a level	+1d10
Owner has training in Perception	+2
Owner has been to Eldaarich	+2
Owner kills an agent of a sorcerer-king other than Daskinor (maximum 1/encounter)	+1
Owner spies on an ally (maximum 1/day)	+1
Owner preemptively attacks an ally	+1
Owner attempts to remove the crown	-2
Owner performs a significant act for an ally that builds trust between them	-2&lt;/table&gt;
Pleased (16-20)
"I am the Crown of Whispers. You will speak to me now."
	The crown is so pleased with the user that it has subsumed much of the wearer's identity. Its whispers, inescapable and clear, drill deeply into the mind of the wearer, and the crown becomes a part of the owner's psyche.
	(The wearer gains access to the crown's attack power while the item remains at this concordance.)
Attack Power (Psionic, Psychic * Daily): Standard Action. 
	Attack: Close burst 5 (enemies in the burst); Intelligence,
	Wisdom, or Charisma +4 vs. Will
	Hit: 4d12 + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier psychic damage.
	Miss: Half damage.
	Effect: At the start of the target's next turn, it must choose either to attack one of its allies or to take the damage it took from this attack again.
Satisfied (12-15)
"You stay back! The crown is mine!"
	The owner has made enough progress toward the crown's goals that the crown believes the wearer is still worthy of keeping it. The crown demands that its owner keep it safe, and as an incentive, it protects the wearer from psychic assaults.
	(The wearer gains access to the following property while the item remains at this concordance or higher.)
Property: After you take psychic damage, you gain temporary hit points equal to the amount of psychic damage you took.
Normal (5-11)
"Enemies are everywhere. I can feel their eyes upon me. Why are you looking at me like that?"
	The crown is evaluating the owner at this point, determining whether the wearer is worthy. The crown's whispers are insidious, and they slowly plant suspicions and fears into the wearer's mind. 
	(At this concordance, the crown has the characteristics included in its basic description.)
Unsatisfied (1-4)
"You say I'm just jumping at shadows, but sometimes it's good to be afraid of the dark."
	The crown's consciousness recedes during the owner's waking hours, refusing to provide the owner with aid or advice. When the owner attempts to sleep, though, the crown invades the host's mind, planting subconscious suggestions and twisting the owner's dreams to frighten him or her into compliance.
	(While the crown remains at this concordance or lower, the wearer loses access to the crown's utility power and psychic damage property, and the crown gains the following property.)
Property: When you take an extended rest, you regain only a number of healing surges equal to half your maximum healing surges.
Angered (0 or lower)
"Can't someone stop the whispers? I haven't slept in days."
	An angered crown does its best to get its owner killed, hoping to pass on to a new host. The whispers that might have been more muted when the crown was unsatisfied return in force, but instead of clear words, the whispers become paranoid ramblings and screeches of disgust. The angered crown refuses to let its owner sleep or meditate, attempting to exhaust the wearer so the dangers of Athas can end the host's ownership of the artifact.
	(While the crown remains at this concordance, the wearer loses access to the item's domination immunity property, and the crown gains the following properties.)
Properties:
* When you take an extended rest, you regain only one healing surge.
* You take a -2 penalty to all defenses.
Moving On
"Get this thing off me!"
	The Crown of Whispers constantly wants to move closer to Eldaarich and, by extension, Daskinor. When its owner is taking it farther away from that city-state, the artifact might decide to move on. When it does so, the crown tries to get the host killed. Although the simplest solution might be to get the owner to remove it and pass off the artifact to someone else, the inherent madness of Daskinor within the crown prefers vengeance and death. Furthermore, previous owners of the crown could potentially warn future owners away from donning the artifact, and it wants to make sure that future owners are as susceptible as possible to its manipulation.

An artificer in the service of an ancient noble house created the first phial of the empty vessel. His lord became insane after contracting a strange illness, and the artificer was tasked with finding a treatment. After extensive study, he learned that the disease both infused the victim with pernicious shadow magic and slowly drained his empathy and sense of connection to other beings. At his core was a void of moral darkness where the lord's humanity once resided. The artificer feared that if the affliction were left untreated, the lord would attempt to fill that emptiness with the blood of the innocent.
The artificer formed a small phial from simple glass and imbued it with an imperceptible enchantment of serenity. When the lord wore it, the pendant filled him with a form of inner strength that kept the emptiness inside him from taking over.

	</rules>

Goals of the Staff
* Be reunited as a complete entity.
* Return to Fraz-Urb'luu to rule over Hollow's Heart.
* Lead unsuspecting mortals down the path of ruin.

Roleplaying the Staff
Each fragment of the staff communicates telepathically with its possessor but frequently attempts to deceive that person. Its preferred method of deception is to claim to be a human soul trapped in the fragment along with the spirits of demons. It encourages the wielder to commit acts of evil while seeking out the other pieces of the staff but, if it is confronted about the evil deeds, it blames the influence of the "demons" inside it while the "human" continues to plead for freedom. If its wielder is willing to aid the staff, it interacts more openly with that individual.

CONCORDANCE
In addition to seeking out and joining other pieces of the staff to itself, each segment of the artifact delights in acts of dishonesty. Regardless of other conditions, the artifact's maximum concordance is determined by the number of pieces that have been gathered and assembled by a single owner.
&lt;table&gt;Starting score	5
Owner gains a level	+1
Each fragment joined to the first	+5
Owner tricks a good creature into performing an evil act (max 1/day)	+2
Owner does not follow up on information about other staff pieces (max 1/day)	-1
Owner admits to the staff's true nature	-2&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table&gt;Number of Pieces	Maximum Concordance
One	6
Two	12
Three	16
Four	20&lt;/table&gt;

Pleased (16-20)
"The staff and I are meant to rule over greater beings, but I will not forsake my companions . . . trust me."
	The staff might find more comfort from being in the hands of Fraz-Urb'luu, but it is all too eager to trick and destroy demons and mortals while performing as an instrument of its current wielder.

Properties: 
* The item functions as a +4 implement, increasing to +5 if you are 20th level or higher, and to +6 if you are 25th level or higher and the item's concordance is 17 or higher.
* Once per day, you can perform the Summon Demon ritual with no need for components. This item functions as the ritual's focus.

Utility Power (Charm * Daily): Minor Action. 
Effect: Until the end of your next turn, enemies cannot attack you or target you with any effect that targets an enemy. An enemy ignores this effect if you attack it, if it is marked by you, or if it is in your defender aura.

Satisfied (12-15)
"I have reached an understanding with this staff now. You need not concern yourself with its motives."
	The staff is eager to be completed. It spends less time manipulating its wielder and more time seeking to aid the quest to complete the artifact.

Properties: 
* The item functions as a +3 implement, increasing to +4 if you are 16th level or higher.
* The item bonus to skill checks also applies to Diplomacy.

Attack Power (Encounter): No Action.
Trigger: You hit a target with a charm power using this item.
Effect: You slide the target up to a number of squares equal to the item's enhancement bonus, and the target grants combat advantage to you until the end of your next turn.

Normal (5-11)
"I've told you, this staff is less remarkable than you think, now stop asking about it!"
	The staff periodically lies to the wielder to get its way and encourages the wielder to do the same with others.

Property: 
* The item functions as a +2 implement, increasing to +3 if you are 6th level or higher.

Utility Power (Illusion * Daily): Standard Action.
Effect: You become invisible until you hit or miss with an attack, or until the end of your next turn.

Unsatisfied (1-4)
"I'm not so sure I trust you, or anyone. You tell me one thing, but the staff tells me another."
	Subtly, the staff tries to convince its wielder to abandon any companions who are unwilling to pursue its agenda. The staff pretends nothing is wrong while it surreptitiously attempts to manipulate events so that it falls into hands that are more willing or compliant. The staff continues to function as if its attitude were normal, but it gains the following property that the DM can use secretly.

Property: The item uses telepathy 10 to communicate with others and manipulate them into acting against its wielder.

Angered (0 or lower)
"No! I won't lie for you anymore!"
	The staff secretly hampers its wielder and uses its abilities to convince others that its owner is a dangerous liar who must be stopped. The staff continues to behave as if its attitude were unsatisfied, but it gains the following property that the DM must use secretly.

Property: The item provides no item bonus to any skill checks. Instead, the user takes a -4 penalty to Arcana, Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks.

Moving On
"It's all been a lie!"
	A demon of a level equal to the wielder's level + 1d4 appears at a most inopportune time (the middle of a dangerous battle, during a tense negotiation) and attacks the possessor of the staff until it acquires the item or it is destroyed. If the demon is successful, it and the staff return to the Abyss; otherwise another demon appears one week later.	

Staff of Fraz-Urb'luu Lore:
Arcana DC 23: The Staff of Fraz-Urb'luu was lost during the sack of Hollow's Heart after the demon prince was imprisoned in the natural world. Unable to destroy it, his enemies sundered it into pieces. Even individually, however, the fragments contain their creator's malicious love of deception and potent summoning ability.
Arcana DC 31: A great deal of Fraz-Urb'luu's personal power is contained within the staff, but only when it is whole. Reassembling the staff could enable a wielder to usurp control of the 176th layer of the Abyss or potentially destroy the demon prince forever.

Effect (Conjuration): The tapestry creates a 40-foot-by- 40-foot, fully-furnished extradimensional room with 20-foot-high ceilings. The room can be reached only through double doors the tapestry depicts, which are part of the room. Only you and those you designate an pass through the doors. You can close the entrance to make the tapestry invisible after you enter the room. It remains invisible until someone opens the doors.
The gallery's interior is a comfortable temperature and humidity. You can adjust the gallery's interior luminance from darkness to bright light. The gallery lasts until you dismiss it from the outside as a standard action. Any creatures still within when the effect ends reappear in unoccupied spaces nearest the tapestry. </specific>

<specific name="Utility Power (Encounter)"> Standard Action.
Effect: You can use one utility power of a magical tapestry that you can see, including a tapestry viewed using the loom's utility power. </specific>

The Chromodactylic Loom dates back to an early age, not long after the Dawn War, when the gods embarked on many projects of creation in their newwon world. Corellon, god of magic and beauty, joined with Ioun, goddess of knowledge, and Avandra, lady of travel and adventure, to devise a wondrous tool that could create works of art both lovely and practical: ways to travel, keep lore, and discover new things.
	The loom is immense, large enough to fill a ballroom, and its frame is made of the crystallized essence of the Astral Sea. No yarn or thread is needed to use it: The weaver merely envisions the colors and materials, and the loom's strings provide. Working its horn-and-ivory shuttle through the web of starstuff causes magical strands to appear in its wake. Such wondrous magic exhausts the loom's power to create new works for a year and a day.
	The loom's power cannot be used to destroy. Attempts to create a tapestry of destructive power or a hanging intended for evil ends simply fail: the weaving does not appear, or it becomes a mundane object. Anyone who attempts to use the artifact for such purposes loses its favor, and the loom quickly moves on to another.
	The Caretaker has been the loom's guardian and partner for longer than anyone can tell. It is near immortal, and its interests are so closely aligned with those of the loom that the two have been inseparable. Perhaps the Caretaker is a fey or divine being, or maybe its life span has been magically extended by its partnership with the artifact. Until a new heir comes along, the two are not likely to grow apart. The Caretaker can activate the powers of any tapestry in the gallery without meeting any normal requirements.
	Many of the wonders that hang in the gallery were woven on the loom. It has the power to create a scene that exists in its own reality, and it can open or cut the way to that realm at will.

Goals of the Loom
* Create wonderful new things and send them into the world.
* Celebrate and protect works of art, especially those that are created from thread or cloth.
* Prevent the destruction of beautiful things, and destroy creations that would cause harm.

CONCORDANCE
In addition to seeking out and joining other pieces of the staff to itself, each segment of the artifact delights in acts of dishonesty. Regardless of other conditions, the artifact's maximum concordance is determined by the number of pieces that have been gathered and assembled by a single owner.
&lt;table&gt;Starting score	5
Owner uses the loom to create a magic tapestry	+2d4
Owner destroys a cursed, evil, or otherwise destructive item (in the loom's estimation) (1/day)	+1d6
Owner creates a worthy piece of art (in the loom's estimation) (1/day)	+2
Owner knowingly allows a work of art to be destroyed	-1
Owner destroys a work of art, or uses a work of art for evil ends	-2
Owner destroys a creation of the loom	-4&lt;/table&gt;

Pleased (16-20)
The loom is delighted by its owner's commitment to beauty and discovery.
	Its owner gains the use of the following property and utility power as long as the loom remains at this concordance.

Property: 
* You cease to age.

Utility Power (Teleportation * Daily): Move Action. 
Effect: You open an extradimensional rift that allows creatures to teleport to an unoccupied space within 10 squares of a tapestry woven on the loom. The rift remains open for 1 minute or until you take a minor action to dismiss it.

Satisfied (12-15)
The loom recognizes a true effort to create and is willing to assist its owner in discovering unseen wonders.
	Its owner gains the use of the following property as long as the loom remains at this concordance or higher.

Property: 
* While on the same plane as the loom, you have blindsight 3.

Normal (5-11)
The owner has the potential to create great things but not the commitment. The artifact reserves its judgment for the time being.
	At this concordance, the loom has the powers and other characteristics listed in its statistics block.

Unsatisfied (1-4)
The loom considers its owner too slothful or materially invested to protect objects of beauty. Unless the owner devotes serious effort to its ends, the loom will not stay long.
	The property granting the ability to create higher level magic items is not available to the owner until the loom's concordance again increases to 5 or higher.

Angered (0 or lower)
The owner is willfully destructive and/or concerned only with the accumulation of possessions, and the loom seeks to find someone who will fulfill its divine function as quickly as possible.
	The owner cannot use the loom's utility powers as long as it remains at this concordance.

Moving On
The imperative to create, nurture, and share beautiful objects drives the loom. Should someone appear who is more dedicated to this purpose than its current owner, the artifact eventually finds its way to that person. The Caretaker has served the loom admirably for centuries, but a greater patron might yet arise.
	If the loom is pleased when it moves on, its owner retains the ability to create higher-level magic items.

The cyclops that absconded with the broadsword Fragarach quickly met a grim end, after which the weapon changed hands many times. Eventually, it came into the possession of the Temple of Elemental Evil,7 but a party of adventurers returned it to the noble prince who had previously wielded it. In areas where the sword has become legend, numerous lesser magic blades have been forged in its image. Over the centuries, many of these imitations have ended up in Mag Tureah's treasure vaults.
	Fragarach is intelligent and communicates empathically with its wielder. It has but one goal: to kill Thrumbolg. To achieve its aim, the sword cajoles its wielder into action with whatever images and feelings will appeal to him or her. It might display visions of Mag Tureah's fabulous treasure vaults to an avaricious character, or show the horrors of the fortress's slave pens to a character who values freedom above all else. The sword has a strong personality, and most of its wielders fall under its sway. They become obsessed with vengeance, develop a brutal "eye for an eye" sense of justice, and compulsively respond to any slight, no matter how minor.

In the dark times following the Cataclysm, the onceadmired Knights of Solamnia fell into great disfavor among their people. Monsters-fell creatures awakened by the fury of the gods' assault-had overrun Solamnia. The Knights of Solamnia fought against these creatures of darkness, but without the blessings of their patron gods, Paladine and Kiri-Jolith, they could not help but falter. In time, the people of Solamnia lost faith in the Solamnic orders and even came to blame the Cataclysm on the knights.
	Born to a long and illustrious legacy of knighthood, the young cadet Sturm Brightblade-son of Angriff Brightblade-was sent with his mother to the distant town of Solace during a particularly dangerous time. Starved and destitute, the peasants of the Brightblades' lands had gone mad and were threatening open revolt. Sturm carried himself as a knight, adhering to the chivalric Code and the Measure, and growing the symbolic mustaches of the Knights of Solamnia, despite the scorn these practices often earned him. Sturm returned to his childhood home years later to find it burned and his father missing. He received his father's armor and the sword Brightblade as his birthright before returning to Solace.
	Crafted by dwarves and presented to Berthal Brightblade two millennia before the War of the Lance, Brightblade is the ancestral sword of the famed Brightblade family of Solamnic Knights. Members of this family have wielded the sword for hundreds of years, generation after generation. According to legend, Brightblade is invulnerable to harm as long as its wielder stays true to the code. The Oath of the Knights of Solamnia (Est Sularis Oth Mithas, or "My honor is my life.") exemplifies that code for the Brightblade clan.

Few heroes have had a more profound impact on Krynn's history than the infamous adventurer, Tasslehoff Burrfoot. A member of the childlike kender race, Tas has been at the center of three wars, befriended gods and dragons, fought powerful adversaries, and helped to save the world on more than one occasion. Like most kender, he had a fearless curiosity coupled with light fingers, and this combination landed him and his companions in a great deal of trouble from time to time. Despite these widely perceived flaws, he was a loyal companion with a true heart, and he eventually acquired a sense of responsibility to his friends that was virtually unique to the kender race.
	Tasslehoff found the knife that would eventually be known as Rabbitslayer in the ruins of Xak Tsaroth while on the run from the Red Dragonarmy. Caramon Majere, disdainful of the small blade, teased Tasslehoff, saying that the dagger would be suitable only for slaying rabbits. Despite Caramon's assertions, the blade served Tas well for the remainder of his career.
	Curiously, no matter where the irrepressible kender left the dagger, he always found it on his person whenever he needed it.

During the Summer of Flame, Tasslehoff and his companion Usha were imprisoned in a chamber in the Tower of High Sorcery at Palanthas, guarded by a fearsome specter. After turning out his pouches in search of anything useful, Tas found this spoon, which he immediately identified as the famous Kender Spoon of Turning-a powerful kender tool for dealing with the undead. Dubious about the spoon's magical powers, Usha remarked that the utensil resembled one of the spoons they had used during supper with Dalamar, the Master of the Tower, and pointed out a smear of strawberry jam on the handle. Tas would not be dissuaded, however, insisting that the spot was the blood of an undead vanquished by the object. The brave kender went on to confront the specter armed only with the spoon.
	No one except members of the kender race has ever confirmed the holy properties of this object. Some speak of the spoon in hushed tones, claiming it to be a holy symbol of Branchala, the god of music and poetry. Others scoff at the notion of a piece of silverware being a holy object, but Tas and Usha did somehow escape from the specter and, ultimately, from the Tower of High Sorcery.

The history of Tanis Half-Elven, born Tanthalas Kanan, began in tragedy. During a raid on the elven community of Qualinesti, a band of human brigands captured and impregnated his mother, killed her husband, and then left her for dead. Though she was eventually recovered and nursed back to health in the household of her deceased husband's brother Solostaran, the Speaker of the Sun, she gradually wasted away, finally succumbing to death after the birth of her half-human son.
	The circumstances of Tanis's conception and birth, as well as his mother's untimely death, affected how the other youths of Qualinesti viewed him. Despite his gift for archery and his charismatic nature, he was forever branded as an abomination in the eyes of many. The Qualinesti regarded full-blooded humans as backward savages, but Tanis by his very existence represented a betrayal, and even elves raised alongside him grew to resent him.
	After befriending the dwarf woodcarver Flint Fireforge, Tanis left Qualinesti to pursue a life on the road. His natural charm and quiet integrity drew others to him, and he eventually became the unofficial leader of his group of companions. It was in this role that he came to the forefront in the War of the Lance.
	During the war, Tanis and his friends volunteered to enter the fortress of Pax Tharkas and rescue several prisoners held by the forces of the Dragon Highlord Verminaard, a powerful cleric of Takhisis. While he and his companions traversed the ancient passage to Pax Tharkas (known to the elves as the Sla-Mori), draconian soldiers in Verminaard's employ ambushed them. Legend holds that during the ensuing melee, the spirit of the long-dead elf hero Kith-Kanan granted Tanis his personal weapon-the ancient sword called Wyrmslayer, crafted eons ago in the Second Dragon War.

In the long history of Krynn's wielders of magic, no one has yet left behind a legacy to surpass that of Raistlin Majere. Born to a poor family in the village of Solace, Raistlin and his twin brother Caramon proved to be opposites in both demeanor and form. Caramon was a hearty youth, easygoing and athletic. Raistlin, on the other hand, had poor health coupled with a fierce intelligence that drew him to the study of the arcane arts-an area in which he proved extremely gifted, even at a young age.
	The exact events of Raistlin's great Test, which is undertaken by anyone wishing to study higher magic, have been the subject of much speculation. The Test is one of survival-a crucible intended to weed out those unsuited for studying the higher mysteries. Raistlin emerged from his test with his already fragile health shattered, and from that time forward wracking coughs periodically shook his body. In addition, his skin had turned a golden hue, and his eyes resembled twin hourglasses. But Raistlin had gleaned more than just physical changes from the Test-he had also acquired the famous relic known as the Staff of Magius.
	According to legend, this staff had once belonged to Magius-friend and trusted companion of the legendary knight Huma Dragonsbane, who had fought in the Third Dragon War. Though not the most powerful item of magic in the Towers of High Sorcery, it nonetheless proved quite useful to Raistlin.

Goldmoon, Chieftain's Daughter of the Que-shu tribe, was worshiped as a living goddess by her people because of her golden tresses-a hue virtually unknown among the people of the Plains. It was the bravery of the stalwart ranger Riverwind, who pledged to return to the village with proof of the ancient gods, that eventually won her heart. On a dark and restless night, Riverwind returned to the Chieftain's Daughter, half-dead and raving, clutching a blue crystal staff in his fevered hands.
	This staff proved to be the catalyst in a series of events that would eventually culminate in the gods' return to the world. An exhausted Goldmoon, with her bedraggled escorts Riverwind and Sturm Brightblade, brought the staff to the Inn of the Last Home. Though the Princess of the Plains would not discover the truth for some time, her blue crystal staff had once been blessed by Mishakal, goddess of healing, and Goldmoon was to become her first cleric since the Cataclysm.
	In the subterranean dungeon of Xak Tsaroth, the nascent priestess and her friends came face-to-face with a creature out of myth-a powerful black dragon named Khisanth. After receiving a vision from Mishakal, Goldmoon sacrificed her life by destroying the staff, engulfing both herself and the dragon in blazing, holy fire. The grief of her companions was short-lived, however, because Goldmoon was restored to life in the Temple of Mishakal, elsewhere in the sunken city.

	During the War of the Lance, however, a group of Heroes discovered the truth of this ancient tale. Led by the Kagonesti elf Silvara, the Heroes located Huma's tomb, wherein lay the silver dragonmetal needed to create the fabled dragonlances.

A Hyrsam fiddle is designed especially for bardic magic, but it is valuable to anybody who specializes in thunderous attacks or invading a person's mind. Because the fiddle is magically enchanted and reinforced, it can be played using almost any handheld object as a bow, or even plucked by hand.

Effect: You conjure four satyr musicians in unoccupied squares adjacent to you, and they begin playing instruments.
The satyrs remain adjacent to you when you move, and when you do so, you can move the satyrs to other unoccupied squares adjacent to you. Enemies cannot move through a satyr's space, but allies can.
Each satyr adjacent to you grants you a +1 item bonus to all defenses and saving throws. Each time an attack misses you or you succeed on a saving throw, one satyr disappears, and the bonus granted by this power decreases by 1. When the bonus reaches 0, all the satyrs are gone and the power ends. Otherwise, the effect lasts for 1 hour. </specific>
No musician need play alone when an entire coterie of fey musicians is only a note away. Hyrsam crafts these items for his friends, but some have found their way into the hands of others-or perhaps into the treasure troves of creatures who have bested the recipients of these horns.

	<specific name="Utility Power (Encounter * Arcane, Charm)"> Standard Action. 
Effect: Ranged 10 (one creature); the target makes a saving throw. The saving throw has a +5 bonus if the target is the same level as you or a higher level. It takes a -5 penalty if the target is a lower level than you or does not have a level.
If the saving throw succeeds, this power has no effect. The target is aware that you used this power on it if it is the same level as you or a higher level. Otherwise, it does not know you used this power.
On a failed saving throw, the target treats you as a trusted friend for 1d4 hours. It truthfully answers all questions you ask and aids you in any way it can as long as doing so does not risk its life or property. While the target is under this effect, you gain a +5 power bonus to Bluff checks against it.
This effect ends if you or any of your allies attacks the target or any of its allies. Afterward, the target doesn't remember that you used this power on it.	</specific>

	<specific name="Property"> Each time you use the crown's daily power, demonic corruption (scales, horns, glowing red eyes, and so forth) manifests on your body. The crown's item bonus to Intimidate checks increases by 1, up to +6, and you take a cumulative -1 penalty, up to -5, to Diplomacy checks. When the Diplomacy penalty would increase to -6, instead your alignment changes to chaotic evil and your character becomes an NPC under the control of the DM. Targets of the crown's daily power-particularly repeat targets-can be subjected to demonic corruption at the DM's discretion. </specific>
	<specific name="Checking the Curse"> Unlike most cursed items, the Sea Prince's Crown can be removed at any time. Doing so, however, does not remove the effects of the curse. The only way to remove the effects of the curse is either to cast the Remove Affliction ritual on the individual suffering from it or to destroy the crown. Once a cursed individual has been completely corrupted by the crown's magic, only destroying the crown can undo the corruption.</specific>

	Each culture has its own legend of how the world will end. Many elves believe that their kind will leave the living realms behind them, and that magic will leave with them. Dwarves cling to the idea of the final forging. Some gnomes believe that reality will wind down like an untensioned spring, while others are sure that the world will explode if they don't improve its design.
 	Each dragon has its own notions regarding the end of the world, but many of these creatures believe in something they call the convergence. When more than one dragon shares such a complex belief, it's an idea worth paying attention to.
	Convergence is the theory that the world ends not in catastrophe but in a broad collapse of all things into one plane—and perhaps into one place. It stems from the many-worlds theory of time: that each choice, decision, or random happenstance occurs in all the ways it can, with each variance splitting off a different world. Most people experience only one such world, but all the others exist. They branch ever outward as infinite different timelines—some barely changed, some vastly different.
	Convergence is the belief that this world-tree must collapse one day. Sages of time have all kinds of esoteric reasons for believing it could, but the functional analogy is this. From the seed that was the start of all creation, a tree has grown. We cling to one small twig of one small branch somewhere in this crowded tree. Sometimes we brush against other branches and see what could have been, or against twigs that have grown longer than ours and see what might be, and these moments are called prophecy. This tree has grown tall and branched far, but it cannot bear all its weight forever. It will eventually collapse into a disordered heap of different branches, and everything will jumble together and become as one. This is convergence.
	Some say the Rod of Convergence is a crack in the world-tree's trunk made manifest. Its powers bring alternate histories and present days closer together, and a version of the rod might exist in every different timeline. A few sages who have studied the rod suggest that it is not merely an artifact of the world-tree, but is a method of propagation. It is moving through world-branches, crossing infinite worlds until it reaches the edge of the world-tree, where it will fall to the formless soil below and sprout a new world-tree. In time, that new tree's branches will entwine with and support those of our own world-tree, preventing the collapse of both through mutual strength.

	It's unfortunate for the stewards of graveyards and crypts that the residents of those places are so valuable to the practitioners of magic. The creator of the first of the artifacts known as the selfsame bones is said to have traveled to her own place of burial after death. Known among those who study time as Mirim, she dug up her own bones and worked magic on them, drawing out the memories of her life and using them as a guide for mapping out the moments to come. In her times of greatest need, Mirim could snap the magic bones she crafted and summon herself to her own aid.
	Since then, no others have mastered time travel to the degree necessary to procure their own bones and enchant them. Instead, adventurers continue to find the Selfsame Bones and are overcome with the sensation that the bones feel strangely familiar. Selfsame Bones do not reveal their working through magical analysis, but rumor and research can reveal their power.
	In the absence of mages making these macabre artifacts for themselves, someone else—somewhere and somewhen else—is creating these one-use talismans and leaving them for their owners to find.

When released, the creature returns to the state in which it was frozen in time (typically dead or unconscious).</specific>
	The god Pelor is best known as the bringer of sunlight, comfort, and healing, but time is also his domain. Once in a dozen worldly generations, Pelor finds it necessary to grant a mortal the authority to defend the sanctity of time. During such events, he dispatches his servant Horologe to bestow the boon known as the Timekeeper's Mantle.
	The one who bears the mantle is addressed by Horologe as "Timekeeper" and receives a number of benefits that aid in the protection of time. The Timekeeper is charged with defending the universe against threats to time from many quarters, including the powerful wizards whose research into controlling time might bring the world close to catastrophe.
 	Dark, scheming gods also yearn to steal control of time away from Pelor. Tharizdun wishes to sunder time, rending it to chaos and disorder in the course of extinguishing all creation. Vecna seeks to pull time under his purview, knowing that even as time makes creatures forgetful of secrets, it is the ravages of time that lichcraft seeks to conquer.
	The creatures that dwell beyond time and space in the Far Realm also wish to corrupt time. Many of them operate outside the bounds of time, and they strongly resent the world for enforcing any form of structured causality on them.

	The diabolic secrets of creating kruthiks were lost to the mortal world after the fall of Bael Turath. Alloces has not deigned to share his methods with anyone since. These facts haven't stopped would-be conquerors from trying to breed their own monstrous armies. In particular, duergar and hobgoblins have repeatedly tried and failed to create their own kruthiks.
	Today, those interested in commanding kruthiks seek to recover the Turathi artifacts that enabled the tieflings to control the ornery beasts. The Fell Court, a cabal of tieflings based in the Nentir Vale, is dedicated to controlling the legacies of Bael Turath. Their diabolic masters have already granted them dominion over the area's felldrakes, and now they seek the means of controlling kruthiks. The Court's agents, usually dupes, scour the realm for one of the lost Rods of Kruthik Command.
	These minor artifacts were another gift from Alloces. Using his dark knowledge, Turathi warlocks created the first rods by petrifying kruthik hive lords, binding their still-conscious minds to their obsidian bodies, and then amputating their forelimbs and shaping them into a wieldable form. Besides offering protection against kruthiks, these rods can magically enslave the creatures for short periods. Ideally, the wielder dominates a hive lord and then uses it to control the rest of its hive. The drawback to the rod is that psychic emanations of the device can enrage nearby kruthiks, drawing them to attack with great ferocity and cunning.
