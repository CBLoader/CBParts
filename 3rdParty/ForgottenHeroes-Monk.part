    <specific name="Role"> Striker. You typically eschew weapons in favor of unarmed attacks, and you avoid armor in favor of maneuverability and agility. Few can match your speed and poise on the battlefield. Your powers are more than simple attacks; they are complex forms that allow you to strike and move with unmatched grace. You lean toward controller as a secondary role. </specific>
    <specific name="Power Source"> Variable. Your intense focus, constant training, and exceptional talent combine to allow you to harness various combinations of psionic, martial and divine disciplines.  Your primary power source is derived from your monastic tradition. </specific>
    <specific name="Creating"> You can choose any powers you like for your monk, though your choice of Monastic Tradition is likely to influence some of your choices. Dexterity is the most important ability for monks, since all monk attacks rely on it. Depending on your Monastic Tradition, you might favor Wisdom or Strength as your second ability score. </specific>
    <specific name="Class Features"/>
    <specific name="Supplemental"> Full Discipline
Many monk powers have the full discipline keyword. A full discipline power gives you two or more actions to choose from, usually an attack technique and a movement technique. Attack techniques usually require a standard action, and movement techniques are options for your move actions. For a monk, a full discipline power represents a fighting style, a unique combination of a move and an attack.
You can use only one full discipline power per round. However, if you spend an action point to take an extra action, you can switch to a different full discipline power. You can use the techniques of a full discipline power in whatever order you like, and you can choose to use one of the techniques and not the other during a particular round.
The number of times you can use a full discipline power's techniques during a round is determined by the power's type - at-will or encounter - and by the actions you have available that round. For example, you can use the techniques of an at-will full discipline power as many times during a round as you like, provided you have enough of the required actions, but you can use the techniques of an encounter full discipline power once during a round. </specific>
    <specific name="Implement"> Monks usually channel their psionic energy through an item called a ki focus, which is a wooden practice weapon, prayer beads, a manual of lore, or some other object a monk studies or uses during training or meditation. After you attune yourself to a ki focus, you can use it as an implement when it is on your person (see the "Ki Focuses" sidebar).

When you wear or hold your ki focus, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of monk powers and monk paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. You can also add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of weapon attacks you make using a weapon with which you're proficient.

You can also use a weapon with which you're proficient as an implement. When wielding the weapon as an implement, the weapon's characteristics - proficiency bonus, damage die, and weapon properties like defensive or high crit - are irrelevant to your implement powers.

If you have both a magic ki focus and a magic weapon, you choose before you use an attack power whether to draw on the magic of the ki focus or the weapon. Your choice determines which enhancement bonus, critical hit effects, and magic item properties and powers you can apply to that power. You can't, for example, use the enhancement bonus of your ki focus and the critical hit effect of your magic weapon with the same attack. </specific>
    <specific name="Powers"> Your monk powers are called disciplines. They rely on your physical training, mental focus, and mastery of psionic or divine magic to function. </specific>

From high in forbidding mountains to the alleys of a city's meanest district, the ascetic warriors known as monks practice their art. By focusing on their minds and bodies, honing both to near perfection, they master a psionic fighting art that allows them to deliver a punch with the force of a giant's club and to absorb attacks as easily as a heavily armored knight. Monks tap into the psionic potential that rests within themselves, turning that energy further inward to fortify their bodies and sharpen their minds.

Perhaps you set out on this path to put a dark past behind you. Or your village was victimized one time too many by an evil lord or marauding beasts, and you now seek justice. No matter what your motivation, the path of the monk transforms you into a living weapon.

The road opens wide before you. With little more than a walking stick and perhaps a satchel of food, you are ready to take on whatever the world can throw at you. Your years of training taught you to turn your eye inward. Now it is time to look outward and test yourself against the world's dangers.

Choose a Monastic Tradition option. You gain only the Flurry of Blows power or similar striker damage option associated with that option. The damage is triggered only when you hit with a monk power or monk paragon path power during your turn. You are considered to have that option for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.

You can make unarmed attacks with much greater effectiveness than most combatants can. When you make a weapon attack such as a melee basic attack, you can use the monk unarmed strike, which is a weapon in the unarmed weapon group. This weapon has the off-hand weapon property and a +3 proficiency bonus, and it deals 1d8 damage. You must have a hand free to use your monk unarmed strike, even if you're kicking, kneeing, elbowing, or head-butting a target. Also, your monk unarmed strike can benefit from a magic ki focus if you have one (see "Implements" below).

You can make unarmed attacks with incredible effectiveness. When you make a weapon attack such as a melee basic attack, you can use the monk unarmed strike, which is a weapon in the unarmed weapon group. This weapon has the versatile and off-hand weapon properties and a +2 proficiency bonus, and it deals 1d10 damage. You must have a hand free to use your monk unarmed strike, even if you're kicking, kneeing, elbowing, or head-butting a target. Also, your monk unarmed strike can benefit from a magic ki focus if you have one (see "Implements" below).  

In addition, attacks you make with a one-handed improvised weapon do 1d6 damage, and a two-handed improvised weapon does 1d10 damage.  If your DM agrees, you can treat an improvised weapon as a similar simple or military weapon for the purpose of meeting the requirements for a power.

It's always a good time for a drink, but only drinks you take during battle increase your combat abilities. To make this easier, you can carry a wineskin, flagon, tankard, or other drinking container in your off-hand and still use that hand for other purposes, including making attacks. Whenever you roll initiative, your drink total resets to zero. You can increase your drink total by 2 if you spend a standard action doing nothing but drinking or by 1 if you spend a minor action the same way.

You are committed to living and sustaining the peaceful way of life for all sentient beings. Your study is devoted to avoiding confrontation, but you understand that conflict is often the only method of bringing about true peace in these troubled times. Ancient texts and martial techniques have allowed you to extend your limbs exceptionally far, thus avoiding direct combat and keeping enemies of peace at bay. Eventually, not even gravity holds power over you.

You can make unarmed attacks with much greater effectiveness than most combatants. When you make a weapon attack such as a melee basic attack, you can use the monk unarmed strike, which is a weapon in the unarmed weapon group. This weapon has the off-hand weapon property and a +3 proficiency bonus, and it deals 1d8 damage. You must have a hand free to use your monk unarmed strike, even if you're kicking, kneeing, elbowing, or head-butting a target. Also, your monk unarmed strike can benefit from a magic ki focus if you have one.

*UPDATE* The rules for monk unarmed strikes has changed since the playtest. Your unarmed strike no longer can be enchanted, nor does it function as an implement. Talk with your DM about updating your character. A suggested resolution is to sell your enchanted unarmed strike and then purchase a Ki Focus in its place.
