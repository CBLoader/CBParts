    <Flavor> The beasts of the wilderness see and know most of what unfolds in their realm. Few folk heed them, but you have learned to understand and interpret their actions and attitudes. Your woodcraft is short of the magical ability to communicate with animals directly, but it is enough to reveal secrets that others miss. </Flavor>
    <specific name="Short Description"> +2 Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate vs beasts. </specific>
    <specific name="_CS_ShortDescription"> +2 Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate </specific>
    <specific name="Level"> 1 </specific>
You gain a +2 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks against beasts. You can communicate simple concepts and commands to such creatures, though they are under no compulsion to obey you. With a successful Insight check (DC determined by the DM), you can read a creature's body language and vocalizations enough to understand basic messages from it.

    <Flavor> You have clambered over steep cliffs and ranged across imposing mountains. Your knack for climbing allows you to pick out the easiest paths up even the most imposing slopes. </Flavor>
    <specific name="Short Description"> Reduce allies climbing checks whenever you succeed on a climbing check. </specific>
    <specific name="_CS_ShortDescription"> May reduce allies climbing checks </specific>
    <specific name="Level"> 1 </specific>
Whenever you succeed on an Athletics check to climb, you reduce the DC of that climb by 2 for your allies until the end of the encounter. Only allies who see you make the climb gain this benefit.

    <Flavor> You are an expert at reading the signs of a creature's passage. When you inspect an area, a splintered twig or a trampled leaf is enough for you to glean a significant amount of information. Even the slyest rogues and sneakiest warlocks leave behind some trace of their passage. </Flavor>
    <specific name="Short Description"> During a short rest, you can inspect the area for tracks. </specific>
    <specific name="_CS_ShortDescription"> Inspect tracks during short rest </specific>
    <specific name="Level"> 1 </specific>
During a short rest, you can make a Perception check (DC determined by the DM) to inspect the area around you. This area can be as large as 10 squares on a side. If your check succeeds, you determine the number and nature of the creatures that have moved through the area in the past 24 hours. You ascertain when and where they entered the area, as well as when and where they left.

A ranger trains to fight, but sometimes the best tactic is one that allows you to escape from a battle. Like a fox, you use speed and cunning to outwit your foes. They might attempt to hinder your movement, but you easily dodge their attacks. When you strike, you remain one step ahead of your foes, dancing in and out of the battle.

Many hunters learn from the lone wolf, a creature forced to forage on its own. Like a lone wolf, a hunter must sometimes venture into the wilds without the benefit of companions.

From its perch among the winds, high above the ground, a hawk keeps careful watch on the land. When it spots its prey, it strikes in the blink of an eye. This aspect allows you to channel the hawk's speed and also take advantage of the hawk's high perch. In battle, your spirit almost rises out of your body, allowing you to strike true regardless of the obstacles before you.

You gain two of the following abilities of your choice.

Ambush Expertise:
You have wandered through dangerous realms, such as kingdoms ruled by hobgoblin tyrants and mountain ranges jealously guarded by brooding giants. You know not only how to hide yourself, but also how to hide others.
   *When you make a Stealth check, allies within 10 squares gain +2 to their next Stealth check before the end of your next turn.
 
Beast Empathy:
The beasts of the wilderness see and know most of what unfolds in their realm. Few folk heed them, but you have learned to understand and interpret their actions and attitudes. Your woodcraft is short of the magical ability to communicate with animals directly, but it is enough to reveal secrets that others miss.
   *You gain a +2 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks against beasts. You can communicate simple concepts and commands to such creatures, though they are under no compulsion to obey you. With a successful Insight check (DC determined by the DM), you can read a creature's body language and vocalizations enough to understand basic messages from it.

Mountain Guide:
You have clambered over steep cliffs and ranged across imposing mountains. Your knack for climbing allows you to pick out the easiest paths up even the most imposing slopes.
   *Whenever you succeed on an Athletics check to climb, you reduce the DC of that climb by 2 for your allies until the end of the encounter. Only allies who see you make the climb gain this benefit.

Watchful Rest:
Long days spent in the wilds have taught you the best way to set up a camp. By picking out an easily defensible spot and carefully positioning your gear, you ensure that you and your allies have the best chance to avoid an ambush.
   *When you take an extended rest, you and any allies also taking the rest do not take the -5 penalty to Perception checks for sleeping.

Wilderness Tracker:
You are an expert at reading the signs of a creature's passage. When you inspect an area, a splintered twig or a trampled leaf is enough for you to glean a significant amount of information. Even the slyest rogues and sneakiest warlocks leave behind some trace of their passage.
   *During a short rest, you can make a Perception check (DC determined by the DM) to inspect the area around you. This area can be as large as 10 squares on a side. If your check succeeds, you determine the number and nature of the creatures that have moved through the area in the past 24 hours. You ascertain when and where they entered the area, as well as when and where they left.

    <Flavor> All hunters are archers, and your choice of ranged weapon defines an archery style that you will hone and perfect over the course of your adventuring career. Many hunters—from the elves and eladrin of the wild forests to the humans and half-orcs of the plains and tundra—choose the longbow as their signature weapon. Most halflings prefer the shortbow due to its ease of use by smaller combatants, but either weapon excels at mowing down groups of marauding goblins, ores, and other foul creatures. The crossbow is often a more useful weapon in the cramped quarters of the Underdark. The dwarf hunters who took up their profession in the ancient caverns of their race's fallen strongholds favor the crossbow, as do hunters who spend their time in the gloom-tainted forest ruins spread across the borderlands. </Flavor>

Crossbow Hunter:
As an expert with the crossbow, you can reload bolts in the blink of an eye. You have also mastered the intricacies of this weapon, attaining a high level of skill through focused training and practice.

Hunters are the masters of ranged weapons, and they draw on cunning battle tactics to deter their enemies. Reverent allies of the natural world, hunters train in the deep forests and wilderness, tracking down and slaying monsters intent on attacking villages and towns. At the same time, they seek to find harmony with the beneficial creatures of nature, and they learn to dabble in primal power-the magic of nature itself.
     A hunter is a controller first and foremost, manipulating the battlefield using high-precision ranged attacks. Against single targets, however, a hunter's attacks pack a punch that make it lean toward striker as a secondary role.

Scouts learn to wield two weapons at once, from the supple combination of longsword and short sword to the brutal double assault of battleaxe and handaxe. This tactic denies the defensive benefit of a shield, but allows a scout to strike hard and fast. At their best when outnumbered and surrounded, scouts count on speed and accuracy in combat to overwhelm their foes.
     Scouts augment their combat prowess with primal magic, channeling the supernatural power of the natural world to their advantage. Primal power allows a scout to pass by foes unseen, to discourage pursuit, and to keep his or her companions alive in the wild under conditions that would slay lesser explorers outright.

The blind grimlocks navigate the Underdark's tunnels with other senses. Keen hearing, sense of smell, and instinct help them make their way. When they attack, therefore, they do so under cover of darkness, hoping to prey on disoriented enemies. Blinding assault takes its cue from the grimlocks, taking down the enemy while it struggles to find you.
