# CB Parts Index

A repository of part files for CBLoader.

Folders:
* `sorted` - Bugfixes and unimplemented official content.  This is highly recommended.
* `UnearthedArcana` - Optional, experimental, and pre-errata versions of official content.  User Discretion applies.
* `3rdParty` - Content from non-wotc published works (books, pdfs, and other stuff published under the GSL).  Ask your GM before using, but it should be safe.
* `Homebrew` - Content from non-published works (Content found on blogs, forum posts, wikis, discord posts or your local GM's brews).  The literal wild west, anything goes, playtesting may not have happened.
