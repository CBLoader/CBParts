    <specific name="_Rarity"> Rare (Unique) </specific>
1. Black tendrils snake forth from the rod and constrict the target if it is a creature. It is slowed (save ends).

2. You are blinded by a flash of magic (save ends).

3. A gust of wind pushes the target 10 squares.

4. A zone of poison gas in a close burst 2 centered on you appears. Living creatures that enter or start their turn in the zone take 10 poison damage and are weakened until they leave the zone. The zone lasts until the end of the encounter.

5. You become invisible until the end of your next turn, disappearing in a cloud of shimmering dust.

6. The target becomes invisible until the end of your next turn. The rod emits a cackling sound.

7. The rod creates a zone of reversed gravity in a close burst 5 centered on you that lasts until the end of your next turn. Creatures in the zone take falling damage as if they had fallen the distance from the floor to the ceiling. If there is no ceiling, creatures in the zone instead float 10 squares in the air and grant combat advantage.

8. You and the target swap places. A trail of magical sparks flutters in the path between you.

9. If the target is a creature, a force sarcophagus is conjured that seals it in. It is immobilized (save ends). If the target is an object, it is instead affected as if you had cast the Knock ritual on it with an Arcana check result of 40.

10. A lightning bolt arcs out from the rod, attacking each creature in a close line 10 (Dexterity + 3 vs. Reflex). The line must include the target. On a hit, the lightning bolt deals 4d6 + 12 lightning and thunder damage (half damage on a miss).

11. A magic rope lassos the target, allowing you to slide it up to 5 squares, including vertically.

12. If the target is a creature, it becomes affected by a magical haste. It gains an extra standard action on each of its turns until the end of the encounter, or for 5 minutes.

13. If the target is a creature, it is polymorphed into a harmless animal of your choice (save ends). While polymorphed, the target can take no actions other than moving. If the target is an object, you are polymorphed instead (save ends).

14. The target is bathed in faerie fire. If it is a creature, you mark it until the end of the encounter.

15. A fireball issues from the rod, attacking each creature in an area burst 3 centered on the target (Intelligence + 3 vs. Reflex). On a hit, the fireball deals 6d6 + 6 fire damage (miss half).

16. The target regains hit points as if it had spent a healing surge.

17. You may teleport up to 8 squares.

18. The target sprouts demon wings, gaining a fly speed of 6 (hover) until the end of the encounter.

19. The magic of the rod drains your life force. You lose two healing surges.

20. Roll again 3 times, ignoring duplicate results. You may choose the order in which the effects resolve.
