As an arcane striker, you have a resemblance to the warlock.

		<specific name="Implement"> Sorcerers wield daggers and staffs to channel their wild arcane power. When you wield a magic dagger or a magic staff, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of sorcerer powers and sorcerer paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. Without an implement, you can still use these powers.
	Any dagger can function as a sorcerer implement. However, you don't gain a dagger's proficiency bonus when using the dagger as an implement. </specific>
		<specific name="Powers"> Like other arcane classes' powers, your powers are called spells. A sorcerer's arsenal is an eclectic mixture of deadly spells drawn from enigmatic or reckless traditions of magic. More studious arcane practitioners sometimes regard sorcerers as novices who play with dangerous power beyond their control, but the proof of their worth is in the havoc they wreak on their foes. </specific>

The sorcerer is the arcane antithesis of the wizard. Wielding raw, barely contained magical power, sorcerers channel bursts and blasts of arcane energy through their bodies. They gain their power not through rigorous study of esoteric tomes, but by harnessing magic in their blood, waiting to be tapped and shaped. If wizards wield magic as fighters wield swords, a sorcerer's magic is the arcing greataxe of a raging barbarian.
You might be a proud dragonborn scion of ancient Arkhosia, calling on the draconic power of your heritage, or perhaps you were bathed in dragon blood as an infant to fill you with that power. You might have been born in a place where planar forces converged in strange eddies, infusing you with chaos, or perhaps you survived implantation of a slaad embryo, which left the taint of chaos upon you.
Magic pulses through your veins, calling on you to give it expression. As it grows ever stronger, will it consume you or transform you into magic incarnate?

		<specific name="Role"> Striker. Elementalists who specialize in air or fire magic scour their foes with destructive energy, hurling blasts of flame or bolts of lightning. Those who specialize in earth or water magic hinder enemies, catching them in tides and quakes. Few can withstand an elementalist's wrath for long. </specific>
		<specific name="Power Source"> Arcane. </specific>
		<specific name="Creating"> An elementalist is a type of sorcerer, a class introduced in Player's Handbook 2. To create an elementalist, use the character creation rules in the Rules Compendium or the Player's Handbook. The Character Advancement table (page 159) summarizes how many feats and utility powers your sorcerer should gain at each level, as well as when ability scores increase.
	An elementalist has the Elemental Magic  spell source as a class feature (which works like spell sources from Player's Handbook 2) and gains other class features related to an affinity for a particular element. Elementalists gain no encounter or daily attack powers from their class, but instead rely on at-will attack powers that have additional effects activated with the elemental escalation power. </specific>
		<specific name="Supplemental"> Ability Scores
Your elementalist sorcerer requires a superior Charisma score, since all your attacks are based on that ability. Constitution is a very important secondary score, contributing to your ability to channel dangerous bursts of elemental energy.
	Your other ability scores help to complete the portrait of your character and round out your talents. A good Dexterity or Intelligence makes sense as your third-best ability score, providing you with a solid Reflex defense. If you favor Dexterity, you might be a physically oriented elementalist who communes with the elements through rigorous physical exercises. If Intelligence is your choice, you could instead be an elemental sage, a student of the elemental planes and their denizens. </specific>

		</rules>
Disdaining the framework of theories of magic and sympathetic principles, elementalists seize the raw stuff of creation with simple force of will, bending the elements to their whim. Elementalist sorcerers might fashion whips or darts out of fire, create shields and armor from living rock, or inundate their enemies beneath torrents of water.
	Since elementalists arise from very different magic-using traditions, other users of arcane power shun them. These sorcerers practice their arts in isolated monasteries, secretive cabals, and occasionally elemental cults. Often accused of being more reckless and destructive than other kinds of sorcerers, elementalists in turn sneer at spellcasters who seek to create tools and systems for shaping magic at a safe distance. To elementalists, the only right way to wield magic is to dive in headlong and seize power with both hands. Some believe that elementalists are prone to evil or that they revel in reckless destruction, but neither assertion is necessarily true. Like more conventional arcane magic, the elementalist's magic is a tool—and like any tool, it can be turned to evil ends or to good.

A creature that enters a square of this ice or starts its turn there must make a DC 11 Acrobatics check or fall prone. The transformed ice remains frozen until it melts naturally. </specific>

The energy most often associated with elemental water is cold, which is useful in battle and also when defeating the right sort of obstacle or preparing a battleground. This spell instantly causes water in the area to freeze, becoming slick, hard ice. Large bodies of water freeze to a depth of only 6 inches, but that is more than enough to form an impromptu bridge or raft.

Sorcerers are considered heretical arcane practitioners in Erelhei-Cinlu. If they are caught casting spells without having been certified by one of the magical academies, they are thrown in prison for decades, if not slain outright. Because they lack formal training, sorcerers must harness magic through other means, such as channeling their tempestuous feelings.
