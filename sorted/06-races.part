	<RulesElement name="Deva" type="Race" internal-id="ID_FMP_RACE_35" source="Player's Handbook 2" revision-date="8/27/2010 12:39:21 PM">
		<Prereqs> ~DEVA </Prereqs>
		<Flavor> Immortal spirits who embody virtue, born and reborn to mortal life in the world </Flavor>
		<specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>
		<specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
		<specific name="Characteristics"> Dedicated, devout, elegant, enlightened, introspective, mystical, refined, righteous, spiritual, thoughtful </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> In appearance, devas are very similar to humans, but with an unearthly beauty and an uncanny stillness about them. They are almost as tall as dragonborn, but much more slender.
Devas' coloration distinguishes them most strongly from humans. All devas have patterns of light and dark colors on their skin. The light portions are chalk white or pale gray, and the dark areas range from blue or purple to dark gray or black. In any individual deva, either light or dark can be dominant, with the opposite shade appearing in simple, elegant patterns on the face, chest, and shoulders. A deva's hair is typically the same color as these skin patterns.
When sitting or standing at rest, devas remain almost perfectly still, except for the occasional blink of the eyes. They don't fidget or twitch, and their eyes move only when they are actively examining something.
Devas do not have children. When a deva dies, his or her spirit is reincarnated in a new, adult body that appears in some sacred place, such as a mountain peak, a riverbank, or a desert oasis. The new deva retains enough memory of past lives to speak and understand multiple languages and offer the proper prayers and sacrifices to the gods of good. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Devas are refined and polite. They follow the highest moral standards, but they are not afraid of violence. They believe that the pursuit of good is an eternal war with the forces of evil, embodied in rakshasas, demons, devils, and the evil gods and their servant angels. Devas wage that war in their hearts as well, constantly vigilant lest evil take root and corrupt their souls, transforming them into the creatures they most despise.
Because they remember, at least dimly, a life in the Astral Sea spent in close company with the gods, most devas are devout worshipers of the gods of good, especially Bahamut but also Moradin and Pelor. Devas seek to achieve a personal connection with the gods rather than approach them through temples and priests. They worship at meals in their homes, setting an empty place for the absent gods, and strive through meditation and prayer to become more like the gods they serve. Deva adventurers are commonly avengers, clerics, and invokers, who savor the experience of divine power flowing through them without any intermediary.
Devas do not have cities or societies of their own, and their numbers are so small that a deva can spend entire lifetimes without ever meeting another of his or her kind. They live among other races and, at least to some extent, adopt their ways. However, all devas remember elements of the life they had before their incarnation in flesh and the beginning of their cycle of rebirth, and they share some common cultural elements of dress, religion, and habits. Devas favor flowing clothes of fine silks, polished metal armor with winglike shoulder ornaments, and headdresses or helmets that suggest crowns or halos. In other ways, they prefer to live simply, without extravagance. </specific>

Deep in the recesses of memory, devas recall what they once were: immortal servitors of the gods of good, spirits who chose to bind themselves to the world in mortal flesh. For millennia, their souls have been reborn to wage an endless war against the forces of darkness. Most devas are fiercely committed to the cause of good, because they fear what they might become if they turn to evil: A deva whose soul becomes corrupted risks being reborn as a rakshasa.
Play a Deva if you want ...
• to have dimly remembered connections to a thousand heroic lifetimes.
• to embrace the cause of good and strive for perfection in all you do.
• to be a member of a race that favors the avenger, cleric, invoker, and wizard classes.

<RulesElement name="Dragonborn" type="Race" internal-id="ID_FMP_RACE_1" source="Player's Handbook" revision-date="11/05/2010 00:00:00 AM">
    <Prereqs> ~DRAGONBORN </Prereqs>
    <Flavor> Proud, honorable warriors, born from the blood of an ancient dragon god. </Flavor>
    <specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>
    <specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
    <specific name="Characteristics"> Driven, honor-bound, noble, perfectionist, proud, reliable, reserved, rooted in ancient history </specific>
    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Dragonborn resemble humanoid dragons. They're covered in scaly hide, but they don't have tails. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6 feet and half in height and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws, with three fingers and a thumb on each hand. A dragonborn's head features a blunt snout, a strong brow, and distinctive frills at the cheek and ear. Behind the brow, a crest of hornlike scales of various lengths resembles thick, ropy hair. Their eyes are shades of red or gold.
	A typical dragonborn's scales can be scarlet, gold, rust, ocher, bronze, or brown. Rarely do an individual's scales match the hue of a chromatic or metallic dragon, and scale color gives no indication of the type of breath weapon a dragonborn uses. Most dragonborn have very fine scales over most of their body, giving their skin a leathery texture, with regions of larger scales on the forearms, lower legs and feet, shoulders, and thighs.
	Young dragonborn grow faster than human children do. They walk hours after hatching, reach the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3 and reach adulthood by 15. They live about as long as humans do. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> To a dragonborn, honor is more important than life itself. First and foremost, honor is tied to battlefield conduct. Adversaries should be treated with courtesy and respect, even if they are bitter enemies. Caution and discretion are key to a warrior's survival, but fear is a disease and cowardice is a moral failing. 
	The drive to behave honorably extends into the rest of a dragonborn's life: Breaking an oath is the height of dishonor, and attention to honesty extends to every word. A commitment made must be carried out. Ultimately, a dragonborn takes responsibility for his or her actions and their consequences.
	A continual drive for self-improvement reveals an additional aspect of dragonborn honor. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.
	The dragonborn dedication to honor and excellence sometimes leads others to view dragonborn as arrogant and proud. Most dragonborn share a great pride in their race's past and present accomplishments, but they are also quick to admire the accomplishments of others. Even though the tiefling empire of Bael Turath was the enemy of the ancient dragonborn empire of Arkhosia, dragonborn recognize tieflings as worthy companions or opponents, admiring their strength and tenacity as friends or enemies.
	Dragonborn seek adventure for the chance to prove their worth, win renown, and perhaps become champions about whom stories will be told for generations. To win everlasting glory through mighty deeds, daring exploits, and supreme skill. That is the dragonborn dream. </specific>

Born to fight, dragonborn are a race of wandering mercenaries, soldiers, and adventurers. Long ago, their empire contended for worldwide dominion, but now only a few rootless clans of these honorable warriors remain to pass on their legends of ancient glory.	

Play a Dragonborn if you want ...
 * to look like a dragon.
 * to be the proud heir of an ancient, fallen empire.
 * to breathe acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.
 * to be a member of a race that favors the warlord, fighter, and paladin classes.

Playing: When creating a draconian character, consider the following points. 
	You are the boogeyman. Draconians have a well-deserved reputation as killers, conquerors, slavers, and bringers of war. To say that most people don't care for you is an understatement; you are likely reviled by all who behold you. It might take some impressive deeds to persuade members of other races to accept you as the individual you are, rather than just another typically brutal draconian.
	You are proud. Draconians verge on arrogance, certain of their superiority. In spite of their cruelty and vice, most draconians are as fearless and bold as their opponents. Even the staid and proper Knights of Solamnia bear a grudging respect for the courage and guile of their draconian foes.
	You must change. During the war, it was easy to follow the orders of your superiors and to give in to your baser instincts. You were at the top of the food chain, and the creatures you subjugated had to submit to you and your comrades in arms or risk being crushed and discarded. Now, the changing landscape has forced you to find a new path for which you are ill-prepared. You have been forced to acknowledge the shocking reality that your greatest changes are yet to come-if you truly wish to adapt and survive in this world.
	
Bozak draconians are widely regarded as some of the most dangerous soldiers that served under the Dark Queen. Their magical power is exceeded by the auraks and their physical strength is dwarfed by the sivaks, but the bozaks exist in far greater numbers.
	Their natural cleverness and magnetism make them trusted, effective, and intelligent leaders. Bozaks prefer the more destructive flavors of magic, such as elemental evocations, over the subtle spells employed by their aurak cousins.
	Bozaks are dangerous even in death, thanks to their tendency to explode and damage creatures around them at the moment of their demise. A slayer of a bozak draconian might find his or her own death with the sword's final stroke.
	On average, bozak draconians stand just over 6 feet tall and are covered in bronze scales. They have the most highly developed wings among the draconian subraces. Bozaks generally prefer light or no armor, because anything heavier interferes with their arcane gestures and flight.
	Bozak player characters are usually sorcerers, representing those who prefer to delve fully into their natural magical talents, or hexblade warlocks, for those who wish to blend their natural strength and magical power. Bozak sorcerers make adept dragon or cosmic sorcerers, playing to their natural gifts. Bozak hexblades tend to opt for the elemental or infernal pacts. Bozaks can also make effective blackguards or assault swordmages.

Playing: When creating a draconian character, consider the following points. 
	You are the boogeyman. Draconians have a well-deserved reputation as killers, conquerors, slavers, and bringers of war. To say that most people don't care for you is an understatement; you are likely reviled by all who behold you. It might take some impressive deeds to persuade members of other races to accept you as the individual you are, rather than just another typically brutal draconian.
	You are proud. Draconians verge on arrogance, certain of their superiority. In spite of their cruelty and vice, most draconians are as fearless and bold as their opponents. Even the staid and proper Knights of Solamnia bear a grudging respect for the courage and guile of their draconian foes.
	You must change. During the war, it was easy to follow the orders of your superiors and to give in to your baser instincts. You were at the top of the food chain, and the creatures you subjugated had to submit to you and your comrades in arms or risk being crushed and discarded. Now, the changing landscape has forced you to find a new path for which you are ill-prepared. You have been forced to acknowledge the shocking reality that your greatest changes are yet to come-if you truly wish to adapt and survive in this world.
	
Like their bozak cousins, kapak draconians also stand just over 6 feet tall, though their scales are coppery rather than bronze. Bozaks have the overall shape of burly humans, whereas the sinewy kapaks have serpentine features with long limbs and torsos.
	Kapaks have a reputation for being vicious in their dealings with other races and are well known for bullying creatures smaller and weaker than themselves. The wisest among them have learned the value of avoiding attention, and those kapaks are more dangerous for their slyness.
	The kapaks are widely regarded as the fastest and most agile of the draconians. Their impressive speed is far from their most dangerous attribute. Glands underneath their tongues secrete a paralyzing toxin with which they can poison their weapons.
	Like all draconians, they are capable of killing even as they meet their own fate. When kapak draconians die, they immediately dissolve into a pool of highly caustic acid, inflicting horrible burns upon the unwary.
	Kapaks make fine assassins, particularly executioners, as well as effective rogues and thieves. Some kapaks learned to adapt to life in the wilderness as rangers, and a few studied the bardic arts, supporting troops while in the service of the dragonarmies. 
	When creating a kapak draconian character, you can pick from the following benefits.

		<Flavor> Graceful and deadly, at home in the depths of darkness </Flavor>
		<specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>
		<specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
		<specific name="Characteristics"> Arrogant, cold, haunted, pragmatic, rebellious, ruthless, skeptical, sophisticated, urbane </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Drow stand just shy of human height and have slender, athletic builds. Physically, they resemble eladrin, with wiry builds, pleasing features, and midnight black skin that has a blue cast. Their eyes are fiery red, lavender, or blue. All drow have white hair, which most keep long and decorate with intricate pins and webbing wrought from precious metals. Aside from their tresses and eyebrows, drow have little facial hair, though males sometimes grow long sideburns or tufts of wispy hair on their cheeks and chins.
	From infancy, a drow child must be cunning. Children can expect no kindness, no warmth, and no compassion. Such expressions engender fatal weakness. Drow are cold parents, instilling selfreliance and independence, so that their offspring will become strong enough to survive a bloody adolescence. Ill treatment reinforces their natural inclinations toward evil. In rare cases, the harshness of childhood can have the opposite effect, seeding the youth with a hatred of and disdain for drow society and expectations. Such attitudes often lead young drow to a premature end.
	In general, dark elves have life spans somewhat longer than those of their surface-dwelling cousins. Drow who manage to avoid dying a violent death can live for well over 200 years, and exceptional members of the race measure their ages in centuries. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Most drow are singularly wicked. They are cruel in their dealings with others and treacherous among themselves. In the pursuit of power, status, and Lolth's favor, drow houses compete with each other to amass wealth and enslave weaker races. The fickle whims of Lolth's priestesses demand absolute obedience, driving the race to further evil.
	Though most drow are villains firmly in the thrall of the Spider Queen, not all suffer so. Some drow escape the Underdark to find new lives on the surface, while a few reject the dominance of Lolth's priestesses and form mercenary companies or trade consortiums of their own. These, however, are the exceptions. The Spider Queen's church makes bloody examples of any it names enemies of its goddess. Few drow indeed dare to rebel against Lolth's priestesses.
	Drow are born into darkness. Their society is violent and capricious, a world where life is worthless and only power has any meaning. Even drow who escape the clutches of this sinister culture find themselves scarred by the lessons they learned in their youth.
	Drow understand the value of alliances and enjoy congenial companionship, but they regard any such  arrangements as temporary and learn at an early age to distrust love and camaraderie. Such relationships can hide betrayal. Therefore, dark elves are ever watchful for treachery, expecting the worst in those they meet. Drow are never surprised when the knife appears, and they consequently find it hard to form lasting friendships.
	From birth, drow are taught that they are superior to all other races: those who lack the strength to defend themselves deserve to be used as the drow see fit. Drow therefore can be arrogant and condescending until shown reason to respect their associates. Some free drow find these ingrained bigotries hard to overcome. Each drow who escapes the Underdark must come to terms with what he or she has been taught and what he or she sees in the world around. Those who succeed can lead more or less normal lives, while those who fail must endure a miserable existence, trapped between two worlds and finding no haven in either. </specific>

Drow are a decadent race of dark elves whose beauty and sophistication fail to mask hearts all too often stained in evil. The vast majority of dark elves base their behavior and attitudes on the worship of the chaotic evil goddess Lolth, also known as the Spider Queen.
	Drow society is organized into houses. The heads of the most powerful houses occupy leadership positions in the various cities of the Underdark, the subterranean realm beneath Faerûn that the dark elves call home.
Play a Drow if you want ...
• to be good at skulking, striking quickly, and employing a variety of dirty tactics.
• to play a hero in search of redemption, or one who struggles to rise above the wickedness of his or her people.
• to be a member of a race that favors the ranger, rogue, and warlock classes.

		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Dwarves average about 4½ feet in height and are very broad, weighing as much as adult humans. Dwarves have the same variety of skin, eye, and hair colors as humans, although red hair is more common among them. Male dwarves are often bald and braid their long beards into elaborate patterns.  Female dwarves braid their hair to show clan and ancestry. Dwarven attire and equipment, including weapons and shields, are decorated with bold geometric shapes, natural gems, and ancestral faces.
	Although they reach physical maturity at roughly the same age as humans, dwarves age more slowly and remain vigorous well past 150 years of age, often living to see 200. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Proudly proclaiming they were made from the earth itself, dwarves share many qualities with the rock they love. They are strong, hardy, and dependable. They value their ancestral traditions, which they preserve as fiercely as they defend the carved structures of their mountain homes.
	Dwarves believe in the importance of clan ties and ancestry. They deeply respect their elders, and they honor long-dead clan founders and ancestral heroes. They place great value on wisdom and the experience of years, and most are polite to elders of any race.
	More so than most other races, dwarves seek guidance and protection from the gods. They look to the divine for strength, hope, and inspiration, or they seek to win the favor of cruel or destructive gods. Individual dwarves might be impious or openly heretical, but temples and shrines of some sort are found in almost every dwarven community. Dwarves revere Moradin as their creator, but individual dwarves honor those deities who hold sway over their vocations. Warriors pray to Bahamut or Kord, architects to Erathis, and merchants to Avandra or even to Tiamat, if a dwarf is consumed by greed.
	Dwarves never forget their enemies-either individuals who have wronged them or entire tribes of monsters that have done ill to their kind. Dwarves harbor a fierce hatred for the orcs that inhabit the same mountainous areas that dwarf clans favor, and that wreak periodic devastation on dwarf communities.
	To a dwarf, it is a gift and a mark of deep respect to stand beside an ally in battle, and a sign of deepest loyalty to shield that ally from enemy attack. Dwarven legends honor many heroes who gave their lives to save their clans or their friends. </specific>

Playing: Tradition preserves us. Your people have survived for eons by adhering to the ways of their ancestors back to the All-Father. Tradition must be respected, and those who go against it dishonor themselves and cannot be trusted.
	Wisdom comes with age. Those who have witnessed the passage of decades deserve respect. Those who have seen centuries come and go deserve more. Any society that does not respect its elders is dangerous, for it ignores the wisdom those elders represent.
	Blood bears truth. You were born into a society where everything was decided for you, from your profession to whom you would marry when the time comes. These decisions were not the whim of an elder, but the dictates of your bloodline in relation to others. Among gold dwarves, who you become is a direct result of who your parents were and all your ancestors before them. Even far from the East Rift, you understand that getting to know someone means getting to know their past as well.
Gold dwarves see themselves as the founders of the dwarven race, their society able to trace an unbroken line back nearly to the world's creation. It should be no surprise, then, that gold dwarves have a chip on their shoulders—and a heavy one at that. Gold dwarves get along well with others, but they come from a culture where tradition reigns and codes of honor are strict. Each dwarf has a predestined role and a place in society that stems from birth order and bloodline. Gold dwarves who stray from such strictures bring great dishonor on themselves and shame to their clans.
	The largely isolated kingdoms of the gold dwarves had begun to expand before the Spellplague hit. Many adventurous gold dwarves left the Great Rift and their other traditional lands to explore distant parts of the surface world. This emigration served them well when their homeland was destroyed by the plague. Much of the Great Rift and the surrounding surface was obliterated, leaving in its wake the massive Underchasm and the realm of Great Bhaerynden. The gold dwarves who were spread across Faerûn returned to the area to help rebuild their homeland, and the realm known as the East Rift was built on and in the ruins of the Great Rift. The disaster and the disruption of those dark times caused numerous gold dwarf clans to accept new ideas and new peoples, while some others retreated into xenophobia as a means of holding onto the traditions of the past.

Playing: Even mountains change. Although you honor the past and strive to see the good of the present preserved, you know that nothing lasts forever. This impermanency is a reminder that one should never be too complacent or too proud. The ruins of cultures that fell to false pride litter the North. Only those who develop and guard a true greatness can maintain that greatness.
	Even the strongest steel can break. Among the dwarves, it is said that allies are like axes—despite their strength, both can fail when you need them most. Though you strive to make alliances and return friendship in kind, you always remain wary of others. Your closest comrades are noteworthy exceptions, but you remain on the lookout for disloyalty, greed, and cowardice, particularly from other races.
	A stout shield can both guard and smash. The clan cannot defend itself by hiding in the mountains. Neither can the warrior win merely by blocking attacks. When you face a foe, you must strike out at it. Never fear a challenge so much that you shy away from it.
A long history of internecine war has made the once clannish society of shield dwarves more open. Shield dwarves actively seek out friends and forge alliances against enemies. They judge others by their skill and bravery, not merely the honor of a bloodline or the number of beard hairs gone gray. Tradition, respect for elders, and the bonds of kinship are strong forces in shield dwarf culture. However, no shield dwarf would be thought dishonorable for seeking his or her own destiny, whether doing so involves battling orcs alongside elf allies or becoming a master crafter in a human city.
	The history of the shield dwarves can be traced back through millennia. The sons of Taark Shanat the Crusader founded eight kingdoms, which fought, made alliances, rose to greatness as one nation, and then fell into separate states before vanishing from the face of the world. The last great dwarven kingdom of the North was Delzoun, and few are the shield dwarves who do not claim a connection to the bloodline of that realm.

		<specific name="Characteristics"> Aesthetic, deliberative, detached, free, graceful, magical, otherworldly, patient, perceptive </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Eladrin are of human height. They are slim, and even the strongest simply look athletic rather than muscle-bound. They have the same range of complexions as humans, though they are more often fair than dark. Their straight, fine hair is often white, silver, or pale gold, and they wear it long and loose. Their ears are long and pointed, and their eyes are pearly and opalescent orbs of vibrant blue, violet, or green, lacking pupils. Eladrin can't grow facial hair and have little body hair.
	Eladrin children grow much as human children do, but their aging process slows to a crawl when they reach maturity. They enjoy youth and health for most of their lives and don't begin to feel the effects of age until the middle of their third century. Most live for over 300 years, and even at the end they suffer few of the infirmities of old age. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Eladrin society straddles the boundary between the Feywild and the natural world. Eladrin build their elegant cities and towers in places of striking natural splendor, especially where the veil between the worlds is thin-isolated mountain vales, green islands along wild and storm-wracked coasts, and the deepest recesses of ancient forests. Some eladrin realms exist mostly in the Feywild, only rarely touching the natural world; others permanently straddle both planes of existence. A few appear in the world at sunset each day, only to fade back into the Feywild at dawn.
	Long-lived and strongly tied to the Feywild, eladrin have a detached view of the world. They often have difficulty believing that events in the mortal realm are of much importance to them, and they consider courses of action that can last for centuries. Some of the oldest eladrin see the world as a distraction-a source of unwanted intrusions, needless fearmongering, and meddlesome people of other races. If they could, they would shut down every gate between the Feywild and the natural world.
	However, many younger eladrin reject such narrow views. They see all too clearly the continuing rise of evil in the world and the encroaching darkness that surrounds their once-grand realm. These eladrin venture into the world in the hope of forging stronger ties between their homeland and the lands of humans, elves, dwarves, and halflings. However, the aloof reputation of their race makes such ties difficult to forge and maintain.
	Eladrin live by an aesthetic philosophy common to the Feywild and personified by Corellon, the god of beauty and patron of the fey. Eladrin seek to exemplify grace, skill, and learning in every part of life, from dance and song to swordplay and magic. Their cities are places of stunning beauty that shape and guide their natural surroundings into elegant forms. </specific>

Playing: Each new day brings new horizons. You feel the wanderlust of your people, and you look to fresh experiences to grant you new insights on life. No matter how much you have seen, the world always offers more to explore.
	Magic exists in all things. Most moon elves appreciate the fact that magic can be found anywhere—and often in a surprising form. You know to keep an open mind and accept the power that magic can unlock in even the simplest of objects and weakest of creatures.
	A hidden good cannot be great. While the sun elves built up empires in isolation, the moon elves explored the world and saw their culture thrive and grow. In the same way, you know that good deeds should not be hidden. Others who witness acts of charity and nobility take strength and hope from them. Righteousness should be bolder than villainy.
In the ancient past, the moon elves reveled in travel and exploration. As a result, though they were the largest in number, their empires were the last to rise. Moon elves today still have this wanderlust, and are thus both numerous and widespread. Open to new experiences and honest by nature, moon elves are often seen as worthy companions by the people they meet in their travels.
	Though the Spellplague inspired many sun elves to retreat further into isolation, most moon elves reacted to the tragedy of that period by forming stronger bonds with other races. Many moon elves now consider themselves a citizen of a worldly nation first and an eladrin second. Others have used renewed links with the Feywild to reconnect with their ancient homeland. In turn, a new generation of moon elves now spreads from the Feywild to explore the world.

Playing: Patience solves many problems. Sun elves live long lives, and so can afford to wait for time to take its toll on their enemies and the problems of shorter-lived races. Their long-term plans can take centuries to realize. As a sun elf, you are far more concerned with what might be ahead rather than the troubles of the moment.
	A calm mind remains clear. Maintaining an inner and outward serenity allows you to think more clearly. In dire situations, a solemn outlook helps to keep peril at a distance and allows you to make the most well-reasoned choices.
	Creatures are as they are born. Just as the deer cannot help but be hunted by the wolf, the wolf cannot fail to hunt lest it die. So too must the dwarf grub for gold and the halfling avoid home and responsibility. The rabbit cannot fly any more than the fox can graze to survive. Do not expect others to rise to your level or to change their ways to suit you.
The sun elves have lived apart from the events of the world for thousands of years. Despite the recent turmoil of the Spellplague, they see little reason to change. Indeed, the dangers of the modern age and the proven frailties of those gods not associated with the elves drives many sun elves to depend more than ever on their traditional insularity, closing ranks against outsiders that would spread chaos and doom.
	Taking advantage of the renewed connection to the Feywild represents an exception for some sun elves, but for others it merely proves the point. The elves of Faerie might look and act like the elves of the world, but to many sun elves, they represent as  much of a potential threat as any worldly nation.
	Sun elves mimic the aloof (some might say haughty) nature of their society in their personal interactions as well. They are slow to smile, quick to disparage, and always ready to demonstrate their superior knowledge and skill. These barriers break down over time in the dealings between a sun elf and his or her closest allies, but many sun elves remain forever withdrawn in the company of people who speak plainly and show emotion openly.

		<specific name="Characteristics"> Agile, friendly, intuitive, joyful, perceptive, quick, quiet, wild </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Elves are slender, athletic folk about as tall as humans. They have the same range of complexions as humans, tending more toward tan or brown hues. A typical elf 's hair color is dark brown, autumn orange, mossy green, or deep gold. Elven ears are long and pointed, while an elf 's eyes are vibrant blue, violet, or green. Elves favor a wild and loose look to their hair.
	Elves mature at about the same rate as humans, but they show few effects of age past adulthood. The first sign of an elf 's advancing age is typically a change in hair color-sometimes graying but usually darkening or taking on more autumnal hues. Most elves live to be well over two hundred years old and remain vigorous almost to the end. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> When creating an elf adventurer, here are a few points to consider.
	Protect all that is good and beautiful. The natural progression of the universe seems intent on destroying the fleeting grace of beauty, love, and peace. Thus, you must fight to ensure that these things survive. An elf might remain unmoved by the plight of a human city facing an orc invasion, even as an idyllic village of farmers in the horde's path spurs him to action. Elves appreciate beauty because their history has forced them to watch it gradually fade from the world. From the first days of the bitter fey war, through the rise and fall of a succession of worldly empires, the elves know all too well that anything worth enjoying or loving is worth fighting for.
	Life is measured in years, not days. You are acutely aware of the unfurling of years and the grand tapestry of history. Elves plan for the long term, and you are no different. "Enjoy the day; prepare for the year," is a common elf saying that expresses this attitude. You might spend your days in song and drink easily enough, but all the while in the back of your mind, you watch a web of events unfold around you. You understand that an action now leads to a reaction-a change in the world-that might not become evident for years. When you adventure, you keep one eye on the future and your role in the grand scheme of events.
	The strongest sword is guided with wisdom, not might. The best battles are those that are short, decisive, and as bloodless as possible. The elves are too few in number to wage wars of attrition, and they view risky tactics and frontal assaults as foolish at best. As an elf, you employ the most direct methods to defeat your enemy. Why waste time battling goblin patrols when the entire tribe will scatter with the death of its conquest-minded king? Keep the long-term view in mind, and settle all problems with quick, decisive resolution.
	Tales and songs. The elves preserve their history through songs and tales told in the oral tradition. As a young elf, you would have heard and memorized these stories of great elf heroes, their legendary deeds, and the struggles of your people. You might draw on the nature, events, or themes of such stories for inspiration, or to express your elven point of view to your allies. </specific>

Playing: All other cultures are wrong. You might have left your people by your own choice, but that decision has not changed how you view the world. Among your kind, all ways but those of the wild elves represent corruption and iniquity. Though you might be more open to the customs of other folk than most of your kind, it is hard for you to entirely set aside your distrust of those people.
	The world knows more than any elf. You view the natural world and its primal spirits as cousins and friends. You see portents in the change of the weather, the flight paths of birds, and the health of plants. Those places where the world cannot display its natural order—cities, dungeons, magical terrain—seem dangerous to you, because you cannot depend on signs you cannot read.
	Birds fly because they have wings. Wild elves are nomads who must constantly wander. Corellon placed that wanderlust in the souls of your people—the impetus that brought the first elves to the world. Just as a bird must fly when its wings are strong enough, so too must you move on when the spirit takes you.
Of all the fey folk of the world, wild elves live most closely with nature. Indeed, many wild elves see themselves as the only true examples of their race, since they are the only ones living as their ancient ancestors did. At first glance, because of their body paint and beadwork, wild elves can easily be mistaken for primitive hunter-gatherers. Their culture, however, contains complex and intricate traditions that have survived largely unchanged from the time of the Crown Wars.
	Wild elves are more isolationist than their sun elf cousins—often violently so. Those wild elves who do interact with members of other races are sometimes seen as tainted from that contact. As such, wild elves who choose to forge strong bonds with others must often forsake close ties with their kin.

Playing: It is wise to be compassionate, but not all compassion is wise. You seek to help others, but you must guard yourself against deception and hidden dangers. Be ruthless when the situation calls for ruthlessness. Like the bow, you are supple and harmless when danger is not at hand, but you can turn deadly in a heartbeat.
	Do not waste emotion. Humans, moon elves, and others can easily find themselves swept away by emotion, which interferes with their thinking and prompts them to commit foolish acts. Sun elves, at the other extreme, wall themselves away from their hearts so much that they are often unable to feel anything at all. You choose the middle path, which is to use emotion as your ally in achieving your aims. When you are in the right, feel the righteousness of your actions. When you have cause for wrath, let it give you focus.
	Avoid what troubles you can. If your presence would provoke a needless battle, let peace reign in your absence. Whereas a wild elf might confront or kill a trespasser without a thought, you are content to allow the trespass as long as no real harm is done. Wait, watch, and learn. Then act only when inaction would be the greater evil.
Wood elves resemble moon elves in that they are friendly to other races. However, like wild elves, they prefer to live hidden in the wilderness. Wanderlust has no place in their lives, and they consider themselves the solemn caretakers of ancient empires. Wood elves prefer to build modest settlements, viewing the urban and urbane lifestyles both of the ancient elves and their sun elf descendants to be mistakes.
	After fleeing the destruction of the Crown Wars, the wood elves sought to keep their distance from any conflicts that they believed brought ruin upon their people. However, unlike the wild elves and the sun elves, they did not want to detach themselves from the world. The lesson they learned from the destruction of the past was to be compassionate, both toward other elves and the other races that would come to prominence as their own race waned.

		<Prereqs> ~GENASI </Prereqs>
		<Flavor> Energy embodied, chaos and order united-a race of inherent flexibility, passion, and diversity </Flavor>
		<specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>
		<specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
		<specific name="Characteristics"> Capricious, exotic, free-spirited, haughty, headstrong, impulsive, independent, passionate, quick-tempered, quixotic </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Every genasi constantly manifests an element (Genasi have no neutral, nonelemental state.) All genasi are born with one elemental manifestation, a genetic trait that is handed down from his or her parents. Some genasi learn an additional manifestation in late adolescence or adulthood, and a rare few have several.
	Genasi are of roughly the same size and proportions as humans, though they tend toward broader physiques that are evidence of their physical strength. A genasi's body is etched with energy lines that glow in a color associated with the element that the genasi is manifesting. The energy lines on a genasi's body appear in a pattern that is common between members of the same family and sometimes between natives of the same area. The specific configuration of energy lines on each genasi's face and head is distinctive, varying between individuals the way fingerprints differ between humans. Even when genasi change their elemental manifestation, each one retains his or her unique facial energy lines. To show off the energy lines etching his or her body, a genasi often wears clothes that leave at least some portion of his or her body uncovered.
	Genasi skin tones and "hair" also vary depending on which element an individual is manifesting. Genasi don't have actual hair-the substance that appears to cover their heads during different manifestations is a magical expression of their elemental nature.
	The physical qualities that genasi display when using different elemental manifestations are summarized below.
Earthsoul: Brown skin; golden energy lines and eyes; bald with golden energy lines glowing on the head.
Firesoul: Ruddy bronze skin; fiery orange energy lines and eyes; flickering flames coming out of the energy lines on the head.
Stormsoul: Purple skin; silvery energy lines; glowing crystalline silver spikes on the head.
Watersoul: Seafoam green skin; bright blue energy lines; bald with blue energy lines glowing on the head.
Windsoul: Silver skin; light blue energy lines; glowing blue and gray ice crystal spikes on the head.
	Genasi have an average life span comparable to that of humans, roughly 75 years. Some members of the race can live to the age of 90 or 100. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Generalities about a genasi's elemental manifestation are sometimes contradicted by the race's changeable nature. In most regions where genasi live, the dominant manifestation is the one most closely associated with the region's environment. The most extreme example of this truism occurs in underwater communities, where it's essentially impossible for a genasi to survive without the watersoul manifestration.
	In a city whose construction features a number of elevated features and possibly a lot of earthmotes  (such as Airspur, the capital of Akanul), the vast majority of genasi have the stormsoul or windsoul manifestation. In a hot climate or a place where creatures of flame hold sway (such as the city of Memnon in Calimshan), firesoul is the most prevalent manifestation. Genasi are noted for their presence in Akanul, Calimshan, and Returned Abeir, but smaller pockets of genasi can be found most anywhere.
	Genasi who have more than one manifestation think of themselves as having multiple personas. A genasi who is quick-tempered and passionate while manifesting firesoul might be a much more deliberate person while manifesting earthsoul. When free from the demands of travel or conflict, genasi who have multiple manifestations sometimes change manifestation as a method of expressing their mood or their intentions.
	Genasi philosophers believe that genasi were created as a compromise between chaos and the world's divinely crafted forms. A few genasi internalize that  contradiction and struggle to eliminate one or the other of their natures, becoming maniacs of chaos or disciples of order, but those genasi are the exception. Most simply enjoy the connections that their elemental nature gives them to the world.
	As children, genasi express only a single   manifestation. In all but a few areas of Faerun, however, genasi know family members and childhood friends who have manifestations other than their own, so that they grow up knowing the diverse elements their race is connected to.
	Ambition and pride have strongly influenced genasi culture. Genasi are constantly aspiring to improve their station. Their societies bubble with a constant pressure for recognition of true strength and competence. In  consequence, genasi social structures are nowhere near as stable as those created by other races.
	Genasi have no longstanding animosity toward any other races. Neither can they be said to be sure friends of any other race-not even their own. In human cities, some genasi prefer to deal with one group of friends while manifesting one element and keep a different circle of friends in another manifestation. Other genasi find friends who can deal with all their forms. </specific>

Genasi are an inherent contradiction. Each genasi embodies the potential chaos of air and fire, the  order of earth and water, or the ferocity of thunder and lightning. Genasi manifest one of these facets of their elemental soul at all times. Their race is passionate and nearly as diverse as humans. Genasi can be found almost anywhere.
Play a Genasi if you want ...
•	to struggle or experiment with the order and chaos of your existence.
•	to look for adaptability in personality and physical appearance.
•	to be a member of a race that favors the
swordmage and warlord classes.

		<specific name="Speed"> 5 squares </specific>
		<specific name="Characteristics"> Affable, clever, crafty, curious, funny, guarded, inconspicuous, inventive, secretive, sly, tricky </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Gnomes are smaller even than halflings, rarely exceeding 4 feet in height. Apart from their size, they resemble elves or eladrin, with pointed ears and chiseled facial features such as high cheekbones and sharp jaws. They have a more wild look than eladrin do, though, particularly in the hair that sprouts from their heads in random directions. Some male gnomes sprout tufts of hair from their chins, but they otherwise lack body hair.
Gnome skin tone ranges from a ruddy tan through woody brown to rocky gray. Their hair can be virtually any color, from stark white to blond and various shades of brown to autumnal orange or green. Their eyes are glittering black orbs.
Gnomes are as long-lived as eladrin, living over 300 years, but they show more of the effects of age. A gnome over the age of 100 has gray or white hair and skin that shows the wrinkled and weathered lines of a century of laughter, but even the oldest gnome retains the strength and agility of youth. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> In quiet forests of the Feywild and remote woodlands in the world, gnomes live out of sight and mostly beneath the notice of larger races. Gnomes dwell in homes dug among the roots of trees, easily overlooked and cleverly concealed by camouflage and illusion. They are fond of the burrowing mammals that share their habitat, such as badgers, foxes, and rabbits, and have a sense of kinship with these small animals that share their forests.
Unobtrusiveness is a virtue among gnomes. They grow up on games of stealth and silence, in which the winner is the last to be discovered. An adult gnome who draws attention in a crowd is considered dangerously rude. Gnome folk heroes are not mighty warriors, but tricksters who slip out of captivity, play great pranks without being detected, or sneak past magical guardians. They deflect both aggression and attention with humor, and they guard their thoughts with friendly laughter.
Gnomes also value a quick mind and the ability to come up with a clever solution to any problem. They appreciate witty conversation, especially rapidfire repartee. They are inventive and resourceful, although they have little interest in or aptitude for the kind of technology found in human cities. They have an innate talent for magic and a love of illusion, music, poetry, and story.
Eager to see what the world has to offer and willing to be awed by its wonders, gnomes greet the world with open curiosity. Gnomes who are drawn to adventure are most often driven by curiosity and wanderlust above any desire for wealth or glory.
Gnomes were once enslaved by the fomorian rulers of the Feydark, the subterranean caverns of the Feywild. They regard their former masters with more fear than hatred, and they feel some degree of sympathy for the fey that still toil under fomorian lashes-particularly the spriggans, which some say are corrupted gnomes. Gnomes are not fond of goblins or kobolds, but in typical gnome fashion, they avoid creatures they dislike rather than crusading against them. They are fond of eladrin and other friendly fey, and gnomes who travel the world have good relations with elves and halflings. </specific>

In the Feywild, the best way for a small creature to survive is to be overlooked. While suffering in servitude to the fomorian tyrants of the Feydark, gnomes learned to hide, to mislead, and to deflect-and by these means, to survive. The same talents sustain them still, allowing them to prosper in a world filled with creatures much larger and far more dangerous than they are.

		<specific name="Characteristics"> Competitive, daring, driven, inquisitive, powerful, reliable, restless, trusting </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Goliaths tower over even dragonborn, standing between 7 and 8 feet tall. Their skin is gray or brown, mottled with darker patches that they believe hint at some aspect of each goliath's fate or destiny. Their skin is speckled with lithoderms, coin-sized growths of bone that appear like pebbles studding their arms, shoulders, torso, and head. A bony ridge juts over their gleaming blue or green eyes. Male goliaths are bald, and females have dark hair they typically grow long and wear in braids.
Goliaths have life spans comparable to those of humans. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Goliaths are driven by a fierce love of competition. Anything that can be conceived as a challenge invites goliaths to keep score, tracking their progress against both their comrades and themselves. A goliath fighter might remark on how many times he has drawn first blood in battle within a particular dungeon compared to the party's rogue, and he's certainly mentally tracking his own performance against his last adventure. This competitiveness takes the form of good-natured rivalry among goliaths. As a race they have no patience for cheaters, gloaters, or sore losers, but goliaths can be very hard on themselves when they fail to measure up to their own past accomplishments.
Daring that borders on foolhardiness is also a common trait among goliaths. They have no fear of heights, climbing sheer mountain cliffs and leaping great chasms with ease. Their nomadic lifestyle of hunting and gathering instills in them an inquisitive interest in whatever lies over the next ridge or at the head of a canyon. To a wandering hunter's mind, that curiosity can lead to better hunting grounds or a good water source that would otherwise go undiscovered.
Goliaths respect and revere the natural world, and goliath adventurers commonly draw on the primal power source. Druids and shamans are more common among them than clerics, and goliath priests-called skywatchers-invoke the spirits of nature and their ancestors far more often than they call on the distant gods of the Astral Sea. Some goliath tribes also honor Kord, Melora, and Avandra, particularly those tribes that have frequent contact with other races. Tribes that regularly trade with dwarves sometimes offer sacrifices to Moradin as well. </specific>

Goliaths are mountain-dwelling nomads who see life as a grand competition. Their scattered bands have never been major players in the politics of the lowland world, but they have wandered the mountain ranges of the world since the primordials first shaped the peaks and valleys. Tall and massive, goliaths revere the primal power of nature and use it to enhance their own strength.

Halflings have the same range of complexions as humans, but most halflings have dark hair and eyes. Halfling males don't have beards, but many have long, full sideburns. Halflings of both genders often wear complicated hairstyles, featuring complex braiding and weaving techniques.
	Halflings typically dress in clothes that match their surroundings, preferring earth tones and various shades of green. Their clothing and gear feature woven textures and stitching. Birds, river patterns, boats, and fish are common images in halfling art and decoration.
	Halflings have life spans comparable to those of humans. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Halflings are an affable, warm, and cheerful people. They survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. They appear harmless, and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife.
	Halflings are practical and down-to-earth. They concern themselves with basic needs and simple pleasures, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Adventurers are no more rare among halflings than among other races, but they usually pursue the adventurer's life for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. Halfling adventurers are brave and faithful companions, relying on stealth and trickery in battle rather than raw might or magic.
	Halflings are extremely curious. Most can't refrain from opening a door to see what it conceals, or to turn a corner or climb a hill just to find out what lies beyond. Along with this intense curiosity, many halflings seem possessed of a kind of fearlessness-their curiosity and need to experience new things overcoming any hesitation brought on by anxiety.
	In the absence of royalty or nobility, halflings instead look to family elders to guide them. This emphasis on family and community has enabled halflings to maintain a consistent culture for thousands of years, unaffected by the rise and fall of empires.
	According to halfling legend, Melora and Sehanine created the halflings together, giving the race a love of nature and the gift of stealth. When their interest waned, these gods stopped looking after the race, or so the legends go, and halflings made their own way in the world. They say Avandra, the god of luck, admired their resourcefulness and adopted them, favoring them with good fortune. Not all halflings worship Avandra, but nearly all breathe a prayer of thanks to her when fortune favors them. </specific>

	Half-elves usually adopt the dress and hairstyles of the society they spend the most time with; for example, a half-elf raised among a barbaric human tribe dresses in the furs and skins favored by the tribe and adopts the tribe's style of braids and face paint. However, it would not be unusual for half-elves raised among humans to seek out articles of elven clothing or jewelry so that they can proudly display signs of their dual heritage.
	Half-elves have life spans comparable to humans, but like elves they remain vigorous well into old age. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Half-elves are more than just a combination of two races-the combination of human and elf blood produces a unique race with qualities all its own. They share some of the natural grace, athleticism, and keen perceptiveness of elves, along with the passion and drive of humans. But in their own right, they are charismatic, confident, and open-minded and are natural diplomats, negotiators, and leaders.
	Half-elves like to be around people, the more diverse the better. They gravitate toward population centers, especially larger settlements where members of many races mingle freely. Half-elves cultivate large networks of acquaintances, as much out of genuine friendliness as for practical purposes. They like to establish relationships with humans, elves, and members of other races so they can learn about them, the way they live, and how they make their way in the world.
	Half-elves rarely settle down for any length of time. Their wanderlust makes them natural adventurers, and they quickly make themselves at home wherever they end up. When their paths take them back to a place they have visited before, they track down old friends and renew old contacts.
	Ultimately, half-elves are survivors, able to adapt to almost any situation. They are generally well liked and admired by everyone, not just elves and humans. They are empathetic, better at putting themselves in others' shoes than most.
	Half-elves naturally inspire loyalty in others, and they return that feeling with deep friendship and a keen sense of responsibility for those who place themselves in their care. Half-elf warlords and generals do not order their followers into danger that they would not face themselves, and they usually lead from the front, trusting their allies to follow.
	Half-elves have no culture of their own and are not a numerous people. They usually bear human or elf names, sometimes using one name among elves and a different one among humans. Some are anxious about their place in the world, feeling no kinship with any race, except other half-elves, but most call themselves citizens of the world and kin to all. </specific>

 • to be a member of a race that favors the warlord, paladin, and warlock classes.

		<Prereqs> ~HALF_ORC </Prereqs>
		<Flavor> Fierce warriors who combine human resolve with orc savagery </Flavor>
		<specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>
		<specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
		<specific name="Characteristics"> Brash, ferocious, hedonistic, impulsive, short-tempered, tough, uninhibited </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Half-orcs favor their human lineage in appearance, but are distinguished by skin that tends to various shades of gray, broad jaws, and prominent lower canine teeth-though these are still a far cry from the jutting tusks of orcs. On average, they are taller and stronger than humans as well. Their hair is usually black, though it grays quickly with age. Most half-orcs who live among humans favor human styles of clothing and hairstyle, but a few adopt orc traditions, tying small bones or beads into long braids or bunches of hair.
Half-orcs don't live quite as long as humans do. They mature quickly, reaching adulthood at about 16 years, and rarely live past the age of 60. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Half-orcs combine the best qualities of humans and orcs, though some would argue that the good qualities of orcs are few and hard to find. From their orc blood, half-orcs inherit great physical strength and toughness. They are fierce warriors, fleet of foot as they charge into battle.
Their human blood makes half-orcs decisive and bold, resourceful and self-reliant. They are adaptable and able to make their way in almost any circumstance. Although half-orcs often live on the fringes of society in human towns and cities, they still find ways to prosper in a world to which they don't fully belong.
For all their good qualities, many half-orcs exhibit characteristics that polite society finds uncouth or undesirable. Half-orcs have little patience for complicated rules of etiquette or procedure and find little value in hiding their true opinions in order to spare someone's feelings. They enjoy the simple pleasures of food and drink, boasting, singing, wrestling, drumming, and dancing, and they don't find much satisfaction in more refined or sophisticated arts. They're prone to act without much deliberation, preferring to overcome obstacles as they arise rather than consider every possible outcome and make contingency plans. These qualities lead some members of other races to consider them rude or crass, but others find their brashness refreshing.
Half-orcs generally live among either human or orc cultures-some in bustling human towns or cities, others among remote human or orc tribes. Most half-orcs have two half-orc parents, but sometimes half-orcs marry and have half-orc children with humans or orcs. Orcs show grudging respect to half-orcs for their considerable strength and for their cunning intelligence, which sometimes allows half-orcs to rise to leadership positions in orc tribes.
	Although possessed of many strengths, half-orcs frequently encounter prejudice in human communities. Thus, most half-orcs gravitate to careers involving physical labor or violence. For some, the life of an adventurer is either a natural extension of that trend or a way to throw off the weight of prejudice. The adventuring life also means finding a place in a group of allies and equals-a simple pleasure that is all too hard for many half-orcs to find in the world. </specific>

An obscure legend claims that when Corellon put out Gruumsh's eye in a primeval battle, part of the savage god's essence fell to earth, where it transformed a race of humans into fierce half-orcs. Another story suggests that an ancient hobgoblin empire created half-orcs to lead orc tribes on the empire's behalf. Yet another legend claims that a tribe of brutal human barbarians chose to breed with orcs to strengthen their bloodline. Some say that Kord created half-orcs, copying the best elements from the human and orc races to make a strong and fierce people after his own heart. If you ask a half-orc about his origin, you might hear one of these stories. You might also get a punch in the face for asking such a rude question.
Play a Half-Orc if you want ...
 • to be big, strong, and fast.
 • to harness anger into resilience and combat power.
 • to be a member of a race that favors the barbarian, fighter, ranger, and rogue classes.

		<specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
		<specific name="Characteristics"> Adaptable, ambitious, bold, corruptible, creative, driven, hardy, pragmatic, resourceful, territorial, tolerant </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Humans come in a wide variety of heights, weights, and colors. Some humans have black or dark brown skin, others are as pale as snow, and they cover the whole range of tans and browns in between. Their hair is black, brown, or a range of blonds and reds. Their eyes are most often brown, blue, or hazel.
	Humans' attire varies wildly, depending on the environment and society in which they live. Their clothing can be simple, ostentatious, or anything in between. It's not unusual for several distinct human cultures to live side by side in a particular area and mingle. As a result, human armor, weaponry, and other items incorporate a variety of designs and motifs.
	Humans have average life spans of about seventy-five years, though some venerable members of the race live as long as ninety or more years. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Humans are decisive and sometimes rash. They explore the darkest reaches of the world in search of knowledge and power. They hurl themselves into danger, dealing with consequences as they arise. They act first and ponder later, trusting their will to prevail and their natural resourcefulness to see them through perilous situations.
	Humans always look to the horizon, seeking to expand their influence and their territory. They chase power and want to change the world, for good or for ill. Their settlements are among the brightest lights in a dark and untamed world, and humans constantly seek to explore new lands and settle new frontiers.
	Their self-reliance and bravery inclines humans toward martial classes such as fighter and rogue. They often prefer to find hidden reserves of strength in themselves rather than trust to the magic of wizards or clerics.
	That said, humans tend to be a pious race, worshiping the whole pantheon of gods. Their myths name no god as the creator of their race. Some tales say the gods worked together to create humans, infusing them with the best qualities of each race that had come before. Other tales say that humans were the creation of a god whose name is no longer known-a deity killed in the war against the primordials or assassinated by Asmodeus or Zehir.
	Humans are tolerant of other races, different beliefs, and foreign cultures. Most human settlements consist of diverse enclaves where different races live together in relative peace. The human empire of Nerath, the last great world power, united many different peoples and ruled the land for more than five hundred years before it collapsed about a century ago. Most of the human settlements that survived the empire's fall now stand as fortified bastions against the encroaching darkness. When elven forests are razed or dwarven mines overrun, the survivors often flee to the nearest human town or city for protection.
	Despite the far reach and power of Nerath, humans in the present day are a scattered and divided people. Dozens of small baronies, fiefdoms, and free city-states have arisen from Nerath's ruins, and many of these realms are petty, weak, and isolated. Tensions and misunderstandings can precipitate skirmishes, espionage, betrayal, and even open warfare between neighboring communities. </specific>

		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Kalashtar, which in Quori means "wandering dreams," first came to Eberron 1,800 years ago. They came as a renegade group from Dal Quor that sought to escape religious and philosophical persecution. Agents of Dal Quor known as the Dreaming Dark hunted them until finally the group's leader, Taratai, found an audacious way to escape Dal Quor. She convinced Adaran monks to accept a permanent fusion of their own souls with those of the renegade quori. From that synthesis came kalashtar, and as a result, kalashtar today look similar to the monks who served as the first willing vessels.
The monastery where the sixty-seven humans became kalashtar was a place of refuge, so the humans who lived there were diverse. Kalashtar have thus retained a diversity of appearance, possessing the same variety of skin, hair, and eye colors found among humans. They are usually slimmer and taller than humans, although short or stocky kalashtar exist.
Kalashtar physically develop at the same rate as humans do and have similar life spans. A kalashtar child passes for human at first glance, but a few minutes of observation reveals the key difference. All kalashtar have a manner that is graceful, serene, and serious because of the fragment of quori soul bound within them. While human children run, laugh, and play, kalashtar children engage in the same meditative exercises, martial training, and telepathic conversations as adult kalashtar. For a kalashtar, growing up is a physical process, not a mental or emotional one. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Most kalashtar remain in the temple-keeps of Adar, so any kalashtar traveling around Khorvaire probably has a good reason for doing so. A kalashtar might be driven by a desire to break the Riedran siege of Adar, or could be on the run from the Dreaming Dark.
The typical kalashtar is contemplative and serene. They are compassionate and friendly, but in a cerebral way. Perhaps due to the turmoil within their conjoined souls, kalashtar keep a tight rein on their emotions. A kalashtar demonstrates camaraderie with a wry grin and an offhand remark rather than with a backslap or a ribald joke.
The fragment of quori soul in a kalashtar recalls the escape from Dal Quor. Kalashtar on the run from the Dreaming Dark are wary, although they still try to maintain polite and kind behavior. Kalashtar struggle to integrate the thoughts and sensibilities of their human halves with the strange, intangible memories of their quori souls. Kalashtar flirt with madness. Occasionally, a kalashtar's serene countenance drops to reveal crazed and baffling behavior that is inappropriate or even dangerous. </specific>

Kalashtar look similar to humans, but their outward appearance masks an inner demeanor that is at once serene and wild-cerebral and mad. The kalashtar fled Dal Quor, the region of dreams, eighteen centuries ago and came to Eberron. Today, they are strangers in Khorvaire, seeking refuge from agents of the Dreaming Dark in temple-keeps in the mountains of Adar.
Play a Kalashtar if you want ...
• to play a wise and contemplative character who is capable of momentary madness.
• to be a stranger in a strange land, where every place you visit is full of wonder.
• to be a fugitive on the run from enemies that could be anyone, anywhere.
• to be a member of a race that favors the bard, cleric, paladin, and warlock classes.

		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Revenants are souls of the dead returned to a semblance of life by the Raven Queen or some other agency of the afterlife. Revenants do not appear as undead horrors or even anything like their former selves. When the Raven Queen reincarnates souls, they exist as her special creations, and they have the bodies of her choosing and creation. In this way, such souls are always marked as representatives of the Raven Queen's power. They emerge from the shadow of death fully formed and fully grown, set to handle whatever tasks they have been returned to deal with.
	A revenant has a body that is slender for his or her height, but this form possesses an uncanny toughness that contradicts the apparent build. Revenants have the same range of complexions as humans, but a revenant's skin is ashen and the features are sunken. Eyes are most commonly solid black with a single point of red light burning within them, but other eerie eye colors-including yellow, white, silver, and gold-are not  uncommon. In some cases, the eyes glow with a ghostly light. Revenants' hair typically ranges from black through shades of gray to white. Revenants can grow facial hair, and males often have beards or mustaches that accentuate their ashen countenances.
	A revenant's face and skin clearly set a member of this race apart from other humanoids. A revenant's visage has a masklike quality that can be disturbing to mortal beings. Rough, dark scales appear on the flesh near the ends of a revenant's limbs, marking the revenant as one of those the Raven Queen has allowed back into the world of the living. A revenant's extremities end in strong, black fingernails and toenails that resemble claws. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Death usually represents the gateway to the afterlife or the end of a natural existence. Sometimes, however, death can be just the beginning. For some select individuals, the Raven Queen or another agency of death bars passage to the next stage of existence, turning a soul back toward the natural world. In such instances, fate has other plans.
	A revenant arises not as an aimless corpse but as the embodiment of a lost soul given new purpose. Such a creature walks in two worlds. While the revenant moves among the living, it also exists in the shadows, haunted by the vague memories of a life it no longer possesses.
	Revenants do not build settlements or share a common culture as is customary of the other races. The only attributes that connect these living undead are a set of common physical characteristics and a similar origin and destiny. In all cases, a revenant is purposefully returned to the natural world after succumbing to a cessation of life. Dead, but unable to find its way to whatever waits beyond death's dark gates, the once-living soul is reconstituted as a revenant.
	The gods of death and fate often require agents in the natural world, and they don't always have enough exarchs or aspects to deal with all the work they seek to accomplish. For this reason, revenants are called into existence. However, the rules governing the gods and how they can intrude upon the natural world are often mysterious and seemingly contradictory to mere mortals. For this reason, it seems that revenants enter the world without clear directions or even full memories of the life they once lived.
	Revenants often appear in adult form, fully grown and instinctively capable of dealing with the world around them. Most awaken in a place of the dead, such as a graveyard or a crypt, with only vague memories of whatever went before and usually with a driving compulsion to accomplish some partially remembered task or vaguely defined quest.
	Most revenants remember only fragments of the life they lived before, as well as snatches of a peaceful darkness that immediately preceded their return to the world. Some need time to come to grips with the fragmented memories and driving compulsions. Others take to their new existence easily and without too much analysis and soul-searching. Many recall a woman's voice, soft and melodious, not unlike the gentle flutter of black-feathered wings, that follows them out of the shadows and back to the wakefulness of the natural world. The words are gentle but insistent, and often the source of any compulsion that a revenant experiences upon returning to life. Although each revenant returns to the world in a different way, most recall words that drifted out of the darkness with them. "Arise, my champion," the voice demands of them. "There is work to do." </specific>

		<Prereqs> ~SHADAR_KAI </Prereqs>
		<Flavor> Cold of heart and dark of eye, passion burns still within these people of shadow and deep winter. </Flavor>
		<specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>

		<specific name="Characteristics"> Ambitious, bloodthirsty, detached, excessive, grim, intrepid, rash, ruthless, sinister, thrill-seeking, unconventional, violent, zealous </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Shadar-kai are humanlike, but the weight of existence in the Shadowfell has shaped them to be slightly shorter and much thinner than their human counterparts. A shadar-kai has a colorless complexion that varies from alabaster to dark gray. Shadar-kai hair is similarly drab or raven black. Pale hair might have a hint of color within the range of human norms. The eyes are lustrous and black, lacking any white or clear pupil. Shadows near a shadar-kai sometimes seem to reach out or deepen, especially when the shadar-kai is angry.
Although drab in natural appearance, shadar-kai are quite elaborate and idiosyncratic in personal adornment. They like dark and exotic clothing, jewelry, and weapons, often decorated with swatches of bright color. Hair is similarly ornate and often dyed. All shadar-kai embellish their skin with tattoos, scars, and piercings.
A shadar-kai could live longer than any eladrin. Few do, however; the consequences of extreme living keep them from seeing old age. Some simply fade away, disappearing into shadow and death, perhaps leaving behind a wraith as the soul passes into the Raven Queen's care. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> The Shadowfell saps living creatures of creativity and the will to live. When shadar-kai moved to the Shadowfell ages ago, they were not immune to this depression. Numerous members of their early society gave in to ennui and simply slipped out of existence, driving the shadar-kai to change their lifestyle, embracing strong emotions and peak experiences. These practices, born out of necessity, became traditions over countless generations.
The current culture of the shadar-kai is a study in pushing boundaries. Shadar-kai welcome difficult tasks, as well as physical and emotional extremes, as a way of life. They learn to channel the darkness of the Shadowfell rather than allowing that darkness to consume them. And they accept death as the inevitable end for those who fail to attain the right amount of power or fame.
Shadar-kai embrace living with gusto. The limits of pleasure and pain distract them from the wearying melancholy of the Shadowfell. They also strive for personal greatness, so that if they fail to gain the actual ability to live forever, stories of their great deeds will grant a sort of immortality. In this search for personal glory, most shadar-kai ignore banalities such as comfort, morality, and safety.
The tattoos, scars, and piercings a shadar-kai wears have more than one purpose. They exist as a testament to the wearer's ability to withstand pain as well as a means of personal expression and decoration. Each decoration can also be a record of a deed done, an honor gained, or a misdeed declared.
These records are important, because personal merit is all a shadar-kai really has. Other signs of personal worth, such as wealth, are but manifestations of success-side effects. Money, for example, can be gained by chance. What matters is an affluent shadar-kai's ability to protect his or her holdings and the ability to gain more.
Although shadar-kai leave the Shadowfell to seek fortune in the world and among the planes, a few needs and wants drive a shadar-kai to return home from time to time. Most shadar-kai feel a basic need to visit the enveloping dimness of the Shadowfell at least intermittently. The plane is unlike even the darkest reaches of other planes. Obtaining new adornments and equipment in the proper style often requires a return to the Shadowfell. Shadar-kai also return to their gloomy settlements to spend time among those who see extreme, weird, or even deviant as normal. And they come home to brag.
As a rule, shadar-kai are far from humble about their abilities and accomplishments. Boasting and  bravado, called "crowing" among shadar-kai, are common in shadar-kai gathering places. Shadar-kai crow in battle, talking up their successes and speaking doom to their enemies. During birthdays and other celebrations, shadar-kai have what they call "crowing moots," where boasting is taken to the level of artistic and poetic ritual. In addition to the verbal jousting, moots often include, or degenerate into, physical competitions and duels among the participants. As with other deeds among shadar-kai, the greatest "crower" of a moot gains a token-a physical representation such as a tattoo-to commemorate his or her victory. A few shadar-kai, known as doomspeakers, take this "crowing" custom to a supernatural level, becoming so adept at malediction that they can demoralize and sting their foes with dark threats and bloody predictions.
Truth be known, shadar-kai don't care if their bravado ultimately proves false. Despite their origin, they have no fear of defeat or agonizing death. What they truly dread is to live without having experienced life, fading into nothingness and being forgotten. Death in battle or even execution for a crime is a statement of a life lived. After all, shadar-kai are death's children.
The Raven Queen is a fair mother, if not a loving one. When the shadar-kai called upon her in ancient times, she answered. She still does. While she spares little love, she also never demands the love of her children. Almost all shadar-kai revere the Raven Queen, but each shadar-kai is free to choose his or her destiny and way of life, including religion. </specific>

Long eons in the Shadowfell have shaped the shadar-kai into a fiery and, some say, cruel people. Fighting the apathy pervasive in their home plane, shadar-kai live passionately and fearlessly, if grimly. They see themselves as instruments of death and dissolution, the bringers of the righteous end to complacency, stagnation, and life itself. Theirs is a harsh society of self-interest. Among shadar-kai, the strong of body and mind excel and create legends. The weak molder to dust, passing into eternity unremembered.
Play a Shadar-kai if you want ...
•	to use your shadow origins to enhance your abilities with dark powers.
•	to be part of a culture that values great deeds and great power.
•	to be a member of a race that favors the avenger, bard, fighter, invoker, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, warlord, and wizard classes.

		<specific name="Characteristics"> Ambitious, brooding, manipulative, paranoid, pragmatic, reserved </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Shades resemble their original human selves, though they sacrifice their native vitality to the ritual that turns them into slender creatures of shadow. Their darkness-piercing eyes become orbs of dull black, dark gray, or purple. Their coloring takes on subdued hues, with most shades having pale skin and lank, black hair. Shades prefer dark, somber clothing of silk, suede, or supple leather, decorated with brass and iron. Their metal weapons and tools are coated with special oils that dull any sheen or reflection.
	The Trail of Five Darknesses has a dramatic effect on longevity, doubling a shade's normal life span. Rumors abound of shades who eventually attain a level of power that allows them to stop aging altogether. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Ambitious, ruthless, and paranoid, shades are humans who trade part of their souls for a sliver of the Shadowfell's dark essence. Even more so than the shadowborn-natives of the Shadowfell descended from the common races-shades are gloom incarnate. No matter what nations or land one was first born into, each shade undergoes a dark rebirth that transforms him or her into a creature of stealth and secrecy who is caught between life and death. In exchange for the twilight powers granted to shades, the Shadowfell taints their souls with dark thoughts and a darker disposition.
	A human who chooses to become a shade is reborn into shadow through a transformative ritual that draws on the ambient magic present at shadow crossings-places where the veil between the world and its dark echo is thinnest. Known in scholarly circles as the Trail of Five Darknesses, this arduous ritual is as likely to slay its practitioner outright-obliterating body and soul-as it is to grant the ability to wield shadow magic.
	Unbridled ambition and utter desperation are common reasons for a human to undertake the Trail of Five Darknesses, since the taint of the Shadowfell marks a shade as an outcast forever. Shades maintain a determined self-reliance when among their own kind, because they know all too well the greed and duplicity their race is capable of. However, shades also believe in strength in numbers, and as such they congregate in settlements close to shadow crossings, both in the world and the Shadowfell.
	A few shades deny the self-serving nature of their kind, striving to ensure that the true nature of their souls overcomes the shadowy nature of their chosen path. Rejecting their own kind, these shades seek the company of the common races. Drawn to the life of an adventurer, such shades try to earn the trust of a close circle of friends, defending those comrades with the ruthlessness for which their kind is known. However, some decry this behavior as just another facet of the shades' characteristic avarice-treating friends as personal possessions that must be kept safe at all costs. </specific>

		<specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>
		<specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
		<specific name="Characteristics"> Cunning, disquieting, imposing, mysterious, proud, rebellious, self-reliant, sinister, sly, unconventional </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Tieflings' appearance testifies to their infernal bloodline. They have large horns; thick , nonprehensile tails that range in length from 4 to 5 feet; sharply pointed teeth; and eyes that are solid orbs of black, red, white, silver, or gold. Their skin color covers the whole human range and also extends to reds, from a ruddy tan to a brick red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is as likely to be dark blue, red, or purple as more common human colors.
	Tieflings favor dark colors and reds, leathers and glossy furs, small spikes and buckles. Tiefling-crafted arms and armor often have an archaic style, harkening back to the glory of their long-vanished empire. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Hundreds of years ago, the leaders of the human empire of Bael Turath made pacts with devils to solidify their hold over its enormous territory. Those humans became the first tieflings, and they governed their empire in the name of their infernal masters. In time, Bael Turath came into conflict with Arkhosia, the ancient empire of the dragonborn, and decades of warfare left both empires in ruins. Bael Turath's grand capital was thrown down in ruin.
	Tieflings are the heirs of the surviving noble dynasties that ruled the empire. Their bloodline is tainted by their diabolical connections, passing to their descendants through all generations. In many ways, they are human; they can have children with humans, for example, but their offspring are always tieflings.
	Centuries of other races' distrust and outright hatred have made tieflings self-reliant and often too willing to live up to the stereotypes imposed on them. As a race without a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive, and they are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend. However, when a tiefling's companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling quickly learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone trust and loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend and ally for life.
	Although the nobles of Bael Turath subjugated themselves to devils, most tieflings of the present give little thought to gods or patrons of any kind, preferring to look out for themselves. Therefore, tieflings do not often follow the path of the divine; tiefling clerics or paladins are rare.
	Tieflings are not numerous. Sometimes a tiefling merchant clan that is descended from a Bael Turath dynasty settles as a group in a land where wealth can purchase safety and comfort. But most tieflings are born outside such hidden dynasties and grow up in the roughest quarters of human cities and towns. These tieflings often become swindlers, thieves, or crime lords, who carve out a niche for themselves amid the squalor of their surroundings. </specific>

Heirs to an ancient, infernal bloodline, tieflings have no realms of their own but instead live within human kingdoms and cities. They are descended from human nobles who bargained with dark powers, and long ago their empire subjugated half the world. But the empire was cast down into ruin, and tieflings were left to make their own way in a world that often fears and resents them.
Play a Tiefling if you want ...
 • to be a hero who has a dark side to overcome.
 • to be good at tricking, intimidating, or persuading others to do your will.

		<specific name="Characteristics"> Ardent, daring, grudging, jaded, impulsive, passionate </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Vrylokas were originally human, though the bloodbond ritual subtly changes their appearance. Vrylokas have dark gray or blue eyes that turn red when they are angered or excited. Their skin is uniformly pale, ranging from pinkish flesh to chalky white. Most vrylokas have hair in shades of red, from deep scarlet to strawberry blond. However, jet-black hair is found in rare individuals. A vryloka's upper canine teeth might appear slightly more pronounced than the human norm. However, unlike true vampires, vrylokas have no fangs.
	Vrylokas favor clothing and weapons that reflect their ancient origin, from layered robes and tall headdresses to long jackets and trousers, or bodices and skirts. Vryloka garb is often subtly embroidered with bloodred roses and thorns-the symbols of the Red Witch. Vrylokas favor red accentuated with brass and black, and they regard rubies as the most precious of gems.
	Vrylokas' armor is uniformly ornate, with their warriors favoring heavy plate. Their weapons are equally flamboyant, spiked and flourished with rubies and rose motifs.
	The bloodbond ritual causes vrylokas to live to be three hundred years old or more, and they retain their energy and vitality to their dying days. The most powerful vrylokas are said to be immune to the effects of age, though they can be killed like any other mortal creature. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Uncounted centuries ago, in a land of mists and dark forests, the noble families of a now-forgotten kingdom sought a way to increase their life span beyond the meager years allotted to them by their human heritage. One evening, their elders were approached by a mysterious entity known only as the Red Witch-a scarlet-clad figure who held the key to their dreams. She offered to them a powerful blood-bonding ritual that would grant them the vitality of vampires without subjecting them to the taint of undeath. These human nobles became the first living vampires-blessed with great power gained at the price of their own vitality. In later centuries, these creatures became known by the name of the noble family that first forged the pact, the Vrylokas.
	By carefully concealing their true nature, the first vrylokas quickly rose to power, becoming the rulers of their realm. In time, others learned of the dark accord that was the source of their power. An uprising of the vrylokas' human subjects soon followed, and their former kingdom was cast down and lost to the mists of time. However, the living vampires endured.
	Over long generations, these deposed nobles managed to insinuate themselves into the upper classes of other nations, reestablishing their power and prestige. Paying attention to the lessons of their history, vrylokas go to great lengths to keep their true nature secret, living elaborately crafted double lives.
	To the world at large, vrylokas are known as human nobles who were displaced from distant ancestral homelands. But even as they are welcomed into the upper circles of their adopted cultures, the vrylokas maintain their true society in the shadows-a dark court of living vampires constantly plotting for power against each other and the mortal races. </specific>

		<Prereqs> ~WARFORGED </Prereqs>
		<Flavor> Built for a war that has ended, searching for purpose </Flavor>
		<specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>
		<specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
		<specific name="Characteristics"> Aggressive, alert, brave, curious, forthright, industrious, loyal, methodical, naÏve, practical, reserved, simple </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Warforged are bulky humanoids covered in plates of metal and stone. A skeleton of these materials supports woody fiber bundles that comprise a warforged's muscular system.  Warforged bodies have an internal network of tubes filled with a bloodlike fluid that nourishes and lubricates their systems. Their powerful arms end in hands that each have two fingers and one thumb, and each of their feet has two broad toes.
Warforged heads have simple humanlike features. They have heavy brows, hinged toothless jaws, and no noses. A warforged's eyes sometimes glow when he or she experiences certain intense emotions. The forehead of each warforged bears a unique rune called a ghulra. These ghulra help give warforged a sense of individuality.
Warforged possess an artificial and relatively sexless shape. They don't reproduce like other humanoids. A warforged can modify its body, adding and removing limbs as necessary. A warforged feels pain only from real injury. These physical modifications allow warforged to vary in appearance as much as any other humanoids. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Warforged have a straightforward emotional range. Although they experience pain, fear, hatred, and anger like other races, they are reserved and pensive, hiding emotions behind expressionless metal faces. Some warforged lack introspection and are dangerously naÏve or emotionally stunted. Many warforged are the opposite, though. They question the purpose  of their existence and consider whether or not they have souls. A few warforged develop sophisticated philosophies about what they perceive and learn. Many warforged fall in with humanoids of similar mindsets, working passionately for an organization or a religion. A warforged typically forms a strong emotional attachment to a small group of comrades.
A warforged often has limited experiences in the world, having spent its existence assigned to one specific duty. Warforged enjoy working, and many create endless lists of goals and chores. They take pride in their jobs, and they dislike idleness and failure more than most races do. A warforged's sensibilities give it a single-minded efficiency with any task, particularly in combat. War and military conditioning color warforged behavior. Warforged intuitively understand duty, conflict, the chain of command, and other elements of war and soldierly life. Because most warforged have bodies that resemble males, they identify themselves as males and prefer to be called "he" rather than "it." Some warforged adopt female names, though. Most warforged have simple names related to their jobs, abilities, or military positions. Warforged often accept the names or the nicknames that their comrades give them, although some search long for particular names that define them. Many simply take names common within another race, especially those of humans. </specific>

Created as soldiers for the Last War, warforged are artificial humanoids who are intelligent and selfaware. Without a war to fight, freed of their creators, and with no heritage or culture of  their own, warforged are searching for a place in the world.
Play a Warforged if you want ...
•	to be strong, tough, and built for battle.
•	to be a creature searching for the meaning of your existence.
•	to be a member of a race that favors the fighter, barbarian, warden, and paladin classes.

Ameth's closest friend and advisor, Sot-Olmat, pioneered a discipline of rigorous mastery over the elements within a genasi. It is a discipline that one can master through a combination of meditation on a simple mantra and a series of exercises that look harmless but serve to unlock elemental potential within the genasi. The mantra is a repetition in Primordial regarding one's elemental affinity: Fire cannot be chained, or Water cannot be chained. Some manifestations require the mantra be changed: Earth is not chained; earth is the chain. Acid consumes all chains. Sot-Olmat developed this path while a slave, and he continues to expose himself to danger to teach the rudiments of it to other enslaved genasi.
	A genasi who studies this discipline becomes impossible to bind or cage. He or she can escape bonds of all sorts swiftly, becoming a master of escape artistry through the mastery of the elemental nature innate to every genasi.

You might also be a member of another class that uses arcane magic who began studies at Tanathriel but chose a different path than wizardry.
    As an elf or eladrin of virtually any class, you might have served as a guardian of Tanathriel. You could have been stationed outside the border of the vale in which it resides, always on the lookout for creatures that somehow pass through the illusion of the lake and enter the magical valley uninvited. Alternatively, perhaps you're not an elf or eladrin but hail from an indebted caste of guardians of another race assigned to guard Tanathriel's borders from outside. You might never have seen more of the Castle of Dreams than the lake that disguises it despite years of service.
    If you have been inside Tanathriel before, whom do you know best among its cast of characters? What friends or rivals might you have among its students and faculty? Were you trained by one of the characters mentioned above, or did you study under another master (whom you can make up)?

At 11th level, your redeemed deva takes on the dark star paragon path. Freeing oneself from corruption is no guarantee against returning to evil, and no one knows this better than does the fallen deva. Reclaiming your deva form does nothing to dispel those memories and experiences from your time as rakshasa. The wicked memories lurk in your thoughts, urging you to indulge in deviant acts, to embrace vice and wickedness, and to succumb to evil's temptation once more.
    Your dark memories haunt you. Try as you might, you cannot silence the voices nor can you suppress the experiences you found in your fallen state. As you were once able, you can still call upon the memories you carry to aid you, but in addition to the other deva lifetimes, you also can draw upon your time as rakshasa as well. Drawing from these recollections places you at risk of falling once more, but provided you remain fixed toward your path, perhaps one day you will overcome the shame you must shoulder.
    Devas know their redeemed brethren as dark stars, so named for their new ascendancy toward virtue and also for the evil shadowing their souls. Devas are, of course, rare in the world and so dark stars are even rarer-so scarce most might believe them representative of the entire race. As a dark star, you must ever contend with your unpleasant memories while working to earn the redemption you have received.

At 11th level, your veilwalker deva takes on the heavenly deceiver paragon path. You walk just this side of a boundary thinner than the finest veil and develop an affinity for the deceptive magic of the rakshasa even as the memories of past incarnations become distant. You choose your path to take advantage of this power and wield it against evil; or perhaps you are on a path dictated by your carelessness because the intentionally evil would already be beyond redemption. You bear patterns on your skin distinct from those on most devas. The colors are always darker and include more red than their incorruptible brethren. The patterns made by the colorations are sharper, more sudden, and more violent than the simple elegance of other devas.
    The longer you remain a veilwalker, the greater a command over illusion and deceit that balancing act grants you. Manipulation of others becomes an art and a second nature to you.

It appears real to all senses. If the subject of the illusion would normally emit sounds, the illusion can do so as well, but on a limited basis (subject to the DM's judgment) it's not possible, for instance, for the illusion to engage in an extended conversation.
    You can give the illusion simple instructions such as moving in a set pattern, appearing to chew on local plants, and similar actions. You can also match actions to a specific trigger. An illusion might move when a creature moves next to it or cower and scream when it is attacked, for example. The illusion cannot travel outside the area of the burst.
    You make a Bluff check when the deceitful image is created. Creatures that view or interact with the illusion are entitled to Insight checks opposed by that Bluff check to detect that they are viewing an illusion. A creature is allowed a check the first time it sees the illusion and each time it interacts with it. A creature that touches an illusion automatically determines that the image is fake. </specific>

Lolth's return and a resumption of the disastrous war that nearly shattered the elven peoples cast a terrible shadow across Corellon's priesthood. Anticipating this event, the elders formed the Azure Guard who would one day serve as the principle leaders in repelling Lolth's demonic forces. The warriors combine prayers to Corellon with secret arcane spells to achieve the edge they need to overcome their enemies. Azure Guard members do not advertise their special status lest they invite assassins to strike at them. One cannot join the Azure Guard without invitation, and even those called to serve in its esteemed ranks may find themselves unequal to the demands the training makes.

		<specific name="Common Knowledge"> Baldur's Gate bustles with lively trade, and its people go about their daily lives with the self-satisfied expressions of contented citizens. But a threat lurks in the shadows of a nearby forest. Once, beasts and blood ran in the Baldur's Gate streets, and the city came within a whisker of being ruled by the mooncursed. Grand Duke Valarken recently attempted a coup, backed by the werewolves of the Band of the Red Moon, but his defeat sent them all back to the Werewoods, the forest you called home. You don't know the Duke's fate, but you do know the Band of the Red Moon has grand designs on the region.
  You come from Vehlarr, an ancient territory that has become legend. Established centuries ago by its elf werewolf ruler, this city of lycanthropes, elves, and shifters floats in time and space, an effect created by Selune long before the Spellplague. Now it appears only under the full moon, existing both in the Werewood and the Feywild, forming an unstable bridge between planes. Though centuries have passed since its unmooring in the world, Vehlarr has felt only 75 years of that time.
  You grew up in Vehlarr, feeling the erratic influence of both worlds. When you learned of the Band of the Red Moon's expansion plans, you felt you had to help. You disregarded the warnings of your leaders and left, but you waited too long. By the time you reached Baldur's Gate, the Band of the Red Moon had come and gone. Now you can't return home for fear of the welcome you'll get from the werewolves. And their anger at your betrayal will remain fresh for a very long time. </specific>

A farmwife scans the pale dirt road as it winds into the forbidding wood, waiting for someone who will never return. A man stops dead in his tracks, then heads home at a run after seeing bits of blood and fur on a neighbor's doorframe. Such is life in the Dalelands, particularly in Daggerdale.
  Surrounded by hilly forests and rocky, mazelike canyons, the citizens of isolated Daggerdale live in fear of werecreatures striking their villages in the night. The dale has never been a place friendly to outsiders, and shifters are viewed with particular suspicion. Strangers could be lycanthropes in disguise, and the folk of Daggerdale have little doubt that shifters run with the monsters that infest the craggy heights of the Dagger Hills.
  You are a shifter related to the lycanthropes that plague the dale. Perhaps you grew to hate the leaders of your kind after witnessing too much wanton slaughter. Maybe you were exiled, lacking your tribe's hunger and rage. Or perhaps you fled the area after seeing one of your kind captured and killed by the people of Daggerdale. </specific>

Before the Spellplague, Dambrath was a land of barbaric humans enslaved by the Crinti, a half-drow elite. During the Spellplague, the humans turned to emergent primal powers and lycanthropes that resembled their old tribal totems to drive out the Crinti. Today, shifters are common among Dambrath's nomadic tribes, sharing tents and horselines with their human cohorts. Shifters are thought to be blessed by Malar, bestial exarch of the Dambrathan's patron deity, Silvanus.
  You come from one of Dambrath's famous nomadic tribes. They say Dambrathans are born ahorse, and your skills with a mount lend proof to the adage. What is your tribe's totem? Were any natural lycanthropes in your tribe? How peaceful or brutal were your people, and why have you ranged so far from them? </specific>

Meanwhile, the grassy hills and tumbled ruins of Old Vaelan hide a deadly secret: A creature dwells in the ruined dungeons, served by lycanthropes and other deadly creatures. This being, known only as the Whispering One, has demanded sacrifices from Durpar's chakas. Some of those the merchant cabals sacrificed were humans, and the Whispering One saw fit to gift some of them to his servants.
  You were born of a union between a servant of the Whispering One and its human chattel. Your parents kept you hidden for as long as they could, shielding you from the dark secrets of the catacombs, but they couldn't hide you forever. Finally, they sent you as far away as they could.

  This loose collection of shifter tribes and lycanthropes has stalked the area formerly known as the Moonwood since long before the Spellplague.  Malar was their patron god, and they remain devoted to him as the exarch of Silvanus. Many of the smaller tribes, particularly those populated by wereboars and werewolves, still take captives and make sacrifices to Malar in bloody rites. Others have come to take a broader view, and while Beastlord worship forms the basis of their lives, there are times when their existence is not devoted to savagery. Growing up, you came to take pleasure in these moments, and eventually sought out the famed hospitality of Luruar in the hopes of learning more about another way of life. Your attempt did not go smoothly, and you found yourself rejected both by the People of the Black Blood and by the citizens of the city. Clearly, you had to forge your own path. </specific>

One need only touch finger to nose and talk of "hot blood" to indicate that a noble son or daughter carries "the curse."
  Those "who can pass" are trained to suppress their instincts and take on their roles as idle socialites or merchant lords. Those who cannot meet varied fates.

Your purpose has become clear. You see it in the desolation around you, in the ruins scattered across the countryside, in every agonized face you behold. The wind carries it with the stench of carrion, smoke, and fire. The ashes left by defilers, the bone fields that mark the places where tribes, cities or entire races were wiped out-these signs have revealed to you your reason for being: to repair the world.

You benefit from a strong, almost elemental, connection to earth and stone. As a doughty member of your race, you find that the rocks underfoot give you the same sort of power as that offered by the sylvan forests to the fey folk. With your strong link to earth, you can feel new strength flowing through your feet, and you use this strength to become a living avalanche, tumbling through your foes with tremendous force.

	<RulesElement name="Hengeyokai" type="Race" internal-id="ID_FMP_RACE_65" source="Dragon Magazine 404">
		<Prereqs> ~HENGEYOKAI </Prereqs>
		<Flavor> Wily beasts with the ability to assume human form. </Flavor>
		<specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>
		<specific name="Speed"> 7 squares </specific>
		<specific name="Characteristics"> Agile, chaotic, elusive, independent, mischievous, quick, protective, reclusive, secretive, unpredictable, wild </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Hengeyokai are agile creatures, but their other physical attributes vary according to their subrace. Twelve subraces are known to exist: badger, carp, cat, crab, crane, dog, fox, hare, monkey, raccoon dog, rat, and sparrow. Legends abound of other subraces, such as frog, lizard, and weasel, in addition to larger beings such as tigers, dolphins, and pandas; however, no human has ever confirmed their existence.
	The race is exceptionally long-lived, with an unusual life cycle. Hengeyokai can live for over 200 years, but for the first century they exist only as animals and cannot assume another form. Except for their extended life span and above-average intelligence, immature hengeyokai differ little from mundane animals. Once they reach 100 years of age, they can assume hybrid and human forms. At this point, they are the equivalent of human adolescents, but any memories of their previous existence are hazya and indistinct.
	All hengeyokai can assume three distinct forms.
	Animal Form: In animal form, hengeyokai are nearly indistinguishable from normal animals; only careful observation of their behavior can uncover their intelligence. They are exceptionally mobile in this form and often assume it for the purpose of exploration or reconnaissance. Hengeyokai cannot speak in animal form, but they can communicate with beasts similar to themselves.
	Hybrid Form: In this form, hengeyokai stand at their human height on their hind legs or similar appendages. They assume an overall humanoid shape, with front paws, wings, or fins changing into hands that are capable of gripping and using weapons and other equipment, but retain their animalistic appearance, including fur, scales, feathers, tails, and other characteristics. They can speak any languages they know and are still able to communicate with animals. Hengeyokai prefer to assume this form among their own kind or trusted companions of other races.
	Human Form: Each hengeyokai can assume the form of a unique human. While individuals' appearance varies according to the region in which they were born, on average they are shorter and slighter than their human neighbors. Even in human form, hengeyokai always display some animalistic features. For example, a sparrow hengeyokai might have a sharp, beaklike nose; a crab hengeyokai, larger-thannormal hands; and a rat hengeyokai, beady eyes or a long, thin mustache. Hengeyokai in human form can speak any language they know but can no longer directly communicate with animals, though they can still understand them. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> When creating a hengeyokai character, here are a few points to consider.
	You straddle multiple realms. Hengeyokai embody several, often conflicting worlds. Are you more animal or human? Spirit or mortal? Do you feel more comfortable in the wilderness or amid the trappings of civilization? How you answer these questions largely defines who you are, but these inherent tensions tear you in different directions, causing you to act unpredictably by the standards of other races. Many adventuring hengeyokai do so to get a better sense of themselves. What do you hope to discover about yourself during your journeys?
	Guardian, predator, or recluse? Most hengeyokai want to live alone in peace, but others interact with human society more frequently. How do you relate to your neighbors? Those who see themselves as more part of the mortal world will often live among humans and sometimes become the guardians of the families or small villages they encounter; even evil hengeyokai are occasionally forced into this role, though they're more likely to regard their charges as possessions or meal tickets. Hengeyokai who feel superior to their neighbors because of their heritage often become heartless predators, at best using humans for personal gain.
	Your freedom is paramount. When you see animals caged in pens or tied to stakes, you shake your head in sadness. You would rather die than suffer such a fate. As a result, you are constantly on the move, even if you remain in the same area, and you strive to limit your attachments, since not all shackles are literal. Something or someone has to be very important to you to make you stay in one place for a lengthy period. What do you value as much as your own freedom?
	Your wits are a weapon. You're not as big or as powerful as other races, but you make up for that with your wits.  Be smart and fast, and make sure to take advantage of opportunities as they arise, especially those of your own design. Hone this weapon with mischief; it's better for a merchant to catch you stealing now than for a daimyo's guard to do so later. </specific>

		<Prereqs> ~PIXIE </Prereqs>
		<Flavor> Magical fairy folk, childlike mischief-makers, enchanted caretakers of nature </Flavor>
		<specific name="Size"> Tiny </specific>
		<specific name="Speed"> 4 squares, fly 6 squares (altitude limit 1). You cannot use this fly speed if you are carrying more than a normal load. </specific>
		<specific name="Characteristics"> Pixie Characteristics: Brave, charming, childlike, energetic, fierce, magical, mischievous, outgoing, playful, possessive, stealthy, vigilant </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Barely over a foot tall, pixies resemble diminutive eladrin with gossamer wings. These wings sprout from their backs like those of dragonflies or butterflies, but are grander and more beautiful than either. Pixie wings come in as many colors as there are shapes to dreams. Despite their almost insubstantial quality, they are as bright as the clear dawn and as luminous as the full moonrise.
	Pixies rarely appear to onlookers unless they wish to be seen, and other people who happen to spot a pixie are astonished at the first sight of these tiny fey. When pixies fly, a shower of sparkling dust follows in their wake like the glittering tail of a shooting star. Pixie dust is said to be composed of the dreams of the living forest, the gold of the brightest sunbeams, and the starlight cast upon lovers. When such elements are combined as one, they elevate the soul and grant the ability to fly.
	Pixies' eyes come in as many different  colors as their wings. When pixies interact with mortals in the world, their eyes appear to have pupils. However, the natural state of a pixie's eye is a single glittering orb like that of an eladrin.
	Pixies wear light, ephemeral clothing that grants maneuverability while they fly. Noble pixies array themselves like princes and  princesses of the fey, wearing flowing gowns and doublets of spider and caterpillar silk that sparkle like moonlight on a pond. Wild pixies dress themselves in acorns, leaves and bark, and the pelts of woodland beasts. Pixies prefer armor made of acorns, insect chitin, leather, the scales of reptiles, stiff bark, or fine mithral mail. They rarely wear heavy armor.
	Pixies live as long as eladrin. In the Feywild, the race measures time in centuries, and pixies are effectively immortal unless they are slain. However, legends claim that some pixies are so bound to their human reflections in the world that they perish when that human dies.
SPECIAL RULES
As a pixie, keep the following rules in mind.
	Sharing a Space: Because you are Tiny, you can enter the space of a Small or larger creature and end your turn there (forced movement must still end in an unoccupied space, unless noted otherwise). Two creatures are considered adjacent if they are in the same square.
	Altitude Limit: You fall at the end of your turn if you are using your racial fly speed  and are more than 1 square above the ground (see the rules for flying and falling in the Rules Compendium).
	Weapons: Because you follow the same weapon rules as a Small creature, you cannot use a two-handed weapon unless it has the small property. When you use a versatile weapon, you must use it two-handed but don't gain the normal +1 bonus to damage for using it in that manner. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> An enchanted race born of raw fey magic, pixies are the diminutive fairy folk of the Feywild. Under the direction of the Court of Stars, they etch the patterns of frost on the winter ponds and rouse the buds in springtime. They cause flowers to grow and sparkle with summer dew, and they color the leaves with the blazing hues of autumn. Some believe that the pixies stole the secret of honey from the mead goblet of the Summer Queen, then sold it to the bees. It is said that they taught the birds to fly and to sing. These childlike sprites have a penchant for mischievous fun, and there is no game a pixie will not play, no sport it will not attempt, and no revelry it will avoid or decline.
	Once upon a time in the green-gold of the dawning world, the Summer Queen gave birth to a beautiful child. No one knew which of the archfey was the child's father, and the Summer Queen refused to say. Powerful archfey of the Court of Stars gathered around her so that each in turn might bestow his gift on the new fey royalty, for each believed the child was his own.
	The first gift came from the child's mother- the gift of whimsy, so that like the warm winds of summer, she might roam wherever she pleased.
	"But whimsy needs a course and a direction, lest it give way to the destruction of storms," said the Sea Lord, who believed the child was his own. "As young rivers play upon the land before maturing into the great wide sea, so shall the child play." And he bestowed the gift of play on the fey child. 	Then Oran the Green Lord, who also believed the child was his own, said, "Like the frivolous waters, play can overreach its bounds and wreck the labor of others. So I give this child the gift of care. As young seeds are nurtured in the earth that bounds the rivers and the seas, so shall the child care for all things green and alive."
	The Prince of Frost, who knew the child to be his sister, only laughed at the other archfey. "By her silence does the Summer Queen have us doing her bidding for the sake of a child whose provenance we will never know," he said. "And so laughter is my gift to the child. Laughter is the north wind's breath that elevates the spirit in the face of those that would channel, bind, or control it."
	So the child was blessed with the four gifts the Court of Stars had bestowed upon her-whimsy, play, care, and laughter. But after the others had departed, the child's true father secretly appeared beside her gossamer cradle. And then, Corellon, lord of arcane magic, blessed his daughter with the gift of wonder that is the purest form of magic, so that she and all her descendants should ever retain their childlike spirits.
	Legends of the mortal realm say that because the Feywild is the bright reflection of the world, pixies are a reflection of humanity. As the bards tell it, whenever a human child is born, a pixie also comes into existence. The personalities of the two races are indistinguishable during the first few years of life. However, human adolescents cast off their childhood ways, while pixies retain them forever. Sometimes pixies feel compassion for mortals who retain a degree of childhood innocence. They often watch over such humans, secretly aiding their "flawed" reflections with magic when they fall on ill circumstances.
	In the world, pixies were once as prevalent as they were in the Feywild. However, during the years that mortals have ruled, they have diminished and gone into decline. As humanoid civilizations began to flourish, they encroached on the pixies' homelands, pushing the fairy folk back into the Feywild and into the dark unknown beyond civilization. </specific>

		<specific name="Characteristics"> Amicable, capricious, inquisitive, lighthearted, mischievous, tricky </specific>
		<specific name="Short Description"> Born of a union between satyr and nymph, a satyr is always male. Satyrs resemble humans with the legs of goats, and they are covered in fur from the waist down. Most satyrs have a pair of small horns sprouting from their heads,  ranging in shape from a pair of small nubs to the curling horns of the largest rams. They display the broad shoulders and powerful upper bodies of humans, and most sport some kind of facial hair. Their wild, curly hair ranges in length, with younger satyrs keeping their hair short. Older satyrs let it grow as they age, until it hangs about their shoulders.
	Though not as robust as other fey, satyrs lead long lives compared to most humanoids. They reach adulthood at around the same age as humans, but can live to be two hundred years old or more.

		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Born of a union between satyr and nymph, a satyr is always male. Satyrs resemble humans with the legs of goats, and they are covered in fur from the waist down. Most satyrs have a pair of small horns sprouting from their heads, ranging in shape from a pair of small nubs to the curling horns of the largest rams. They display the broad shoulders and powerful upper bodies of humans, and most sport some kind of facial hair. Their wild, curly hair ranges in length, with younger satyrs keeping their hair short. Older satyrs let it grow as they age, until it hangs about their shoulders.
Though not as robust as other fey, satyrs lead long lives compared to most humanoids. They reach adulthood at around the same age as humans, but can live to be two hundred years old or more.

		<specific name="Playing"> A race branded by folklore as tricksters, hedonists, and charlatans, satyrs only partially deserve the dark aspect of their reputation. Satyrs first came to the mortal realm when the world was young and had not yet fully healed from the destruction of the Dawn War. That war drew the Feywild closer to the mortal realm, connecting the two through rifts in the fabric of the planes that the inhabitants of the natural world would come to call fey crossings.
	Possessed of mischievous and investigative souls, satyrs ventured cautiously through the fey crossings and made contact with the fledgling races of the world. Most of these early meetings were brief and violent. Though adventuresome, satyrs are also skittish, even as the humanoids of the world often see unintended threats in the strange and the unknown. From these early encounters came the seeds from which the folk tales sprung-stories of satyrs appearing within frontier villages to spread merry mayhem, and using the magic of song to charm children, maidens, and matrons alike.
	Over time, the growing conflicts of the mortal realm saw the satyrs abandon the fey crossings to sequester themselves in their safe havens in the Feywild. There, they avoided the wars of other races, content to spend their days in revelry rather than try to interfere in the troubles of mortals and fey alike.
	In recent times, the mortal realm has begun to call to the satyrs once again. With the fall of great empires and the collapse of civilization down to isolated outposts in a widening wilderness, the satyrs are drawn to explore that wilderness once more. Their race has become well known to the barbarian tribes and civilized outposts along the borderlands, where they emerge from fey crossings to sate their curiosity regarding the mortal realm. </specific>

		<specific name="Playing"> Hamadryads are the incarnate spirits of living oak trees. Part flesh, part wood, and part fey spirit, they are the granddaughters of the seasons and the wind, and the supreme manifestations of nature's wild beauty.
	At the beginning of time, the world had four daughters more beautiful in form than any creature-and more wild. They were called Summer, Autumn, Winter, and Spring, and they chased one another around the world while the primordials and the gods looked on. In their play, they frolicked with the brothers of the wind, and from this union the first nymphs were born. They were named Summer Ash, Autumn Oak, Winter Fir, and Spring Flower, and they were the spirits of the first trees that grew in the world.
	The capricious nymphs played their own wild games in the forests of the dawning world for time out of mind. But they were not all to dwell in such bliss forever. With the rise of mortals, certain autumn nymphs-the wisest and most pensive of the tree sisters-withdrew from their games when they began to perceive the state of natural life in decline. Woodlands were burned, dryads' groves cut down, and great swaths of the world left lifeless by the wars and the avarice of reckless mortals.
	To protect their homes, these autumn nymphs embraced their wild natures entirely. They gave up their carefree fey immortality and began the slow transformation into the wild tree maidens known as dryads. In these forms, they would protect their forests from harm with mighty branch and crushing limb, using their wisdom to understand the minds and motives of mortal creatures.
	Hamadryads stand at an intermediate state between playful nymph and fierce dryad. Bound to a living tree, a hamadryad ardently protects the forests of which she is a part. She calls on the mighty strength of the wood to smash her enemies, summoning the spellbinding beauty of her majestic fey heritage to bewitch and charm mortals and thereby alter their destructive behavior. Hamadryads retain the flawless physical perfection of their autumn nymph form with all its grace and charm. However, they can harden their flesh to match that of the oldest tree in an instant, just as they solidify their wooden hearts against any hope of compassion.
	Typically, a young hamadryad is bound to a tree home that somewhat resembles her feminine shape. As a youth, she remains in the forest where her tree grows, for her life is bound to its existence. However, rare hamadryads are able to break the connection to their tree home by some twist of fate or  destiny.
	Some do so in the course of surviving the destruction of their tree homes by natural disaster or monstrous forces. Others are drawn far from their forests in the name of undertaking quests meant to save those forests. Some hamadryads dwell close enough to the settlements of the civilization of other races that they take up the struggles of those races. Answering their heart's yearning call, they uproot themselves from the earth and leave all they know behind-seeking the wondrous perils and delights that are the stuff of mortal knowledge and emotion. </specific>

Your tree heritage grants you a +5 racial bonus to Endurance checks to resist the effects of starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and you can survive for twice the normal time period before you are required to make such checks. You do not require sleep, but you must meditate at least four hours each day to absorb light (even from as small a source as a candle), soak in water, or connect with the earth beneath your feet. This meditation grants you the benefits that other races receive from an extended rest. While meditating, you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.

Playing: Sun elves were the aggressors who forced the Llewyrr out of the Llewyrrwood on the mainland, so you harbor a lingering animosity toward them. This distrust extends to other elf subraces as well. Having lived in isolation for so long, most Llewyrr feel no kinship toward their elf cousins, and have no desire to be caught up in elven politics and intrigues. You swear fealty to the High Lady of Sarifal, not the crown of Evermeet.
	You share a bond with the natural world and primal spirits of the land. Unlike many eladrin, the Llewyrr do not worship Corellon Larethian or other divine entities of the Seldarine. Instead, the Llewyrr venerate the "fey gods," mighty primal spirits and archfey that have watched over the Moonshaes for millennia. Greatest among these primal manifestations are the Earthmother and her children.
	Your people have survived for millennia by forming strong family and community bonds, and you honor these. An oath given by a Llewyrr is a binding pledge. Though Llewyrr are slow to trust, once a bond is formed, the friendship lasts a lifetime.
During the Crown Wars, the Llewyrr were a community of moon elves and green elves dwelling in the verdant woodland known today as Neverwinter Wood. When Vyshaan armies swept through their lands, the Llewyrr fled across the sea seeking the fabled isle of Evermeet.
	A fierce squall forced the refugees to make landfall on the Moonshaes, where they were greeted by the enigmatic leShay, legendary progenitors of the fey. The leShay permitted the Llewyrr to settle in isolation and safety among the mountains of the large central island. The Llewyrr named their new kingdom Synnoria, after the queen who led them to this island sanctuary.
	Over the next eleven millennia, the Llewyrr evolved into a unique subrace rarely seen outside the Moonshaes. Llewyrr share many of the same societal attributes of their moon elf ancestors, including the building of grand cities and advanced mastery of arcane arts. Llewyrr have fair skin, but unlike their moon elf cousins, the elves of Synnoria have golden hair. Llewyrr born in the last century share the hauntingly opalescent eyes common to all eladrin, with the pupils of older generations colored in shades of green and brown, with gold flecks.
	At the heart of Synnoria is the resplendent city of Chrysalis, resting upon a verdant tor rising from a crystal clear lake. The city is a dazzling display of soaring glassteel towers, crystalline gardens, and majestic silver-glyphed boulevards.
	Today, much of the city is abandoned, for the Llewyrr have paid a price for their long isolation. Birth rates are low, and centuries of attrition has dwindled their numbers dramatically. Males are uncommon, constituting less than a quarter of the population.

The ability of great dragons to cause dread just by their presence is legendary, but they don't need supernatural powers to inspire fear. A simple look from a dragon can freeze a soul in terror.

You have studied the ways of dragons and practiced something of this charismatic power. Now you can use your dragonfear to hold a foe within your gaze.

When dragons take wing, they are masters of the sky. The greatest of the flying beasts-including wyverns, manticores, griffons, and rocs-hasten away when a dragon's silhouette darkens the clouds. Supreme aerial fighters, dragons often attack from on high, diving through storms of hail or flashing lightning to strike at prey or foes. Although you can't fly, you've taken this tactic to heart, learning to treat the melee around you as the storm and letting it wash off your back as you advance toward your enemy.

		<Prereqs> ~KOBOLD </Prereqs>
		<Flavor> Reptilian tunnel dwellers who stick together to survive </Flavor>
		<specific name="Size"> Small </specific>
		<specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
		<specific name="Characteristics"> Ambitious, cooperative, fawning, greedy, loyal, obedient, quick, timid </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Their spare frames and stooped postures don't inspire fear in others, which suits kobolds just fine. They would rather look nonthreatening but not quite vulnerable. A few brave kobolds emulate their honored dragons. They put on a little muscle, raise their snouts high, and roar with a ferocity no one would expect such weak-looking creatures to muster.
	Kobolds' long muzzles are lined with tiny teeth and lolling tongues similar to those of a dragon or crocodile. Their slitted eyes are usually red, gold, or yellow. Small horns angle backward from a kobold's brow, and bony barbs stud its forearms to its elbows. Its fingers end in stubby talons, as do its long toes. Fine scales cover a kobold's body, usually some shade of green. Brown, red, and orange scales appear among particular tribes, as do mottled hides of several colors.
	Their reptilian anatomy hides kobolds' physical expressiveness from other races. Their facial construction lacks the anatomy to display the same range of emotions as other humanoids. Kobolds who need to deal with warmbloods develop broad arm and head gestures to convey how they feel.
	Since kobolds have to make do with what they scavenge, clothing is limited and functional. A loincloth serves the least among them, while warriors cobble together armor from scraps they harvest from the dead. Crude weaponry suffices until they can steal something better.
	Kobolds grow quickly. They can walk and talk within hours after hatching and reach their full height after about a year. Kobolds can live longer than a century, though very few make it through their first decade. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Kobolds revere dragons, and the small reptilian creatures are masters of traps and ambushes.
	Kobolds look after the tribe foremost, and they take whatever steps they deem necessary to ensure the community's survival. The more populous the tribe, the lower the chance any individual will come to harm-even though such large numbers invariably attract attention. Thus, kobolds nurture their eggs in communal nesting grounds to ensure the next generation will preserve their numbers.
	Even kobolds who leave their tribes retain the instinct to survive and find comrades. An adventuring kobold regards the party as a small tribe and finds a place to contribute to the group's success. He or she shows an immediate willingness to work within the team, especially if the kobold can tackle a job nobody else in the group is suited for.
	Even good-aligned kobolds see little point in fighting with honor. A fair fight achieves nothing if you die. Instead, kobolds admire trickery and subterfuge as virtues and deride as foolish any notion of fairness. The best fight to a kobold is one in which no kobold blood is spilled.
	Kobolds see dragons as living gods and offer sacrifices, prayers, and anything else they find to honor their masters. Their devotion stems from their connection to Tiamat, whom they see as their ultimate goddess and mother to all dragons. Kobolds also worship their ancestors, chief among them being Kurtulmak, a figure thought to be one of Tiamat's exarchs. Adventuring kobolds never quite escape their devotion to Tiamat and continue to worship her even if doing so is offensive to their new companions. No kobold wants to face the repercussions of angering such a threatening god.

When creating a kobold adventurer, here are a few points to consider:
	*You know your way around traps. Even if another character handles the task of disarming traps, you know enough about their construction to help dismantle them when they are discovered and avoid them when they attack. Traps fascinate you, and any new device is an opportunity to add a weapon to your arsenal. Don't pass up opportunities to tackle a trap and, if possible, try to find ways to turn it to your advantage.
	*Fair fights are for suckers. Concepts such as honor, nobility, and fairness make little sense to you. Death comes soon enough without inviting it through some foolish belief. You use trickery and planning to defeat your enemies. You lure them into danger, drawing them into positions where your allies can finish them off. You hit enemies when they're down, dazed, or otherwise incapacitated. Your survival depends on your willingness to do whatever it takes to win.
	*Dragons are gods. Dragons represent everything kobolds hope to become. Everyone fears them. If dragons are not true gods, they are close enough for you. Encounters with dragons awe you, far beyond the threat they pose. You feel conflicted about fighting dragons and seek a peaceful way out of such an encounter, such as by making an offering or spouting excessive flattery. Should your efforts fail, you still support your allies, but killing the dragon should be the last resort.
	*You know your place. Every kobold in a tribe knows that for the rest to survive, each member must do his or her duty. As an adventuring kobold, you see your companions as your new tribe and search for a way to contribute outside of combat. You might cook meals, mend clothing, or polish armor in addition to fulfilling your role during exploration and combat.
	*You exercise caution. Taking heedless risks can get you killed. Better to be prepared and know what you're getting yourself into. If you get in over your head, fleeing is an important tactic. An enemy that gives chase enters unfamiliar territory, often protected by traps. As a kobold, you feel no shame in running away and expect your companions to do the same should the situation turn against you.
	*The world hates you. Being considered vermin by most people you meet is bound to take a toll. No matter what you accomplish, others might be anything from suspicious to hostile. Even most other reptilian humanoids look down on you, though they're more likely to show you some respect if you prove yourself. When traveling through civilized lands, consider concealing your features to avoid conflicts.

When kobolds go searching in corridors they believe to be trapped, they work in teams. Working together increases the odds of survival, either because teammates can warn each other or because they can distribute the brunt of a triggered trap's effects. Most big folk don't go in for this sort of thing, so adventuring kobolds 'recruit' enemies for the job.

		<specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
		<specific name="Characteristics"> Anxious, cunning, deceptive, gregarious, sly, secretive, stealthy, tenacious </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Kenkus are easily identified by their obviously avian appearance. A kenku's head resembles that of a raven, complete with small, beady black eyes and a large, dark beak. Sleek black feathers cover its body, ending at the knees and elbows. Its arms and legs are covered in scaly black skin, and its hands and feet end in talons.
	Young kenkus hatch from eggs. Within a month they are strong enough to join the flock, and they reach maturity in five years. Most die before reaching their third decade, a consequence of the harsh life in a flock, but extremely hardy or devious kenkus have been known to survive for decades. These rare individuals often become leaders of powerful and well-connected flocks.
	Obsessed with avoiding attention, many kenkus garb themselves in drab, loose-fitting clothing that allows them to conceal their features. They favor colors that blend well with shadows and disdain obvious ornamentation. Many kenkus adopt or learn to mimic the mannerisms of nearby peoples.</specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> The first things every kenku learns to do are to hide, steal, and form alliances. No flock tolerates new members that are mere mouths to feed, so fledglings must make themselves useful. They often use trickery and stealth to get what they need and want, forming small gangs to better fulfill their objectives.
	Fledglings learn to exploit the talents of others to ensure their own survival. The tasks they are expected to perform for the flock can be dangerous, so reliable allies are often the keys to success. Those who survive such hardships and take these harsh lessons to heart grow into tough survivors who combine a pragmatic outlook with strong bonds of friendship.
	Anxiety is the typical state of mind for most kenkus. Their beady eyes flit about constantly, ever vigilant for some unexpected threat, and they never stray far from deep shadows. Their penchant for skullduggery earns them enemies, so they flinch at loud or sudden sounds. Living in the shadows means that kenkus know and fear what might lurk there. As a result, they are seldom willing to travel alone: Survival demands cooperation.</specific>

When creating a kenku adventurer, here are a few points to consider:
	Secrets are your strength. Every kenku knows that knowing what someone else wants hidden gives you power over that person. You always keep your ears open for bits of gossip or little-known information that you might be able to exploit later. Although you don't hesitate to resort to extortion or bribery, you are careful not to call in all such favors at once. Having options in a crisis makes your secrets all the more useful tools.
	Allies make you stronger. Life in an aerie is tough. Fledglings survive by forming partnerships and complex alliances. These connections provide information, resources, and future assistance. Although you deal in lies and deceit, you are loath to turn on your companions. You are also always on the lookout for ways to develop your network of contacts and potential allies.
	Fight to survive. When events turn desperate, you work all the harder. Your people are always pragmatic, recognizing that rare is the situation that leaves no option for survival. This attitude is what allowed ancient kenku rebels to scratch out an existence while on the run from the Raven Queen.
	Try to avoid notice. Those whom your people have exploited are more than happy to end your life. The best way to escape enemies is to keep hidden. You rarely reveal your true identity, relying on your allies to ask questions while you hide nearby. Only in dire need do you risk letting anyone catch a glimpse of you.

	<!-- Goblin Race -->
	<RulesElement name="Goblin" type="Race" internal-id="ID_FMP_RACE_21" source="Dungeon Survival Handbook">
		<Prereqs> ~GOBLIN </Prereqs>

		<specific name="Size"> Small </specific>
		<specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
		<specific name="Characteristics"> Adaptable, boastful, curious, cruse, humorous, impressionalbe, instigating, reactionary, sneaky, willful </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> Goblins stand just over three feet tall, with wiry frames that resemble those of human children.  Sometmies humorous, sometimes frightening, each goblin's features are unique and often reflect its personality.  Some goblins have long hooked noses and pointy ears, while others have exaggerated fangs or eyes that seem to bug out of their faces.
	Most goblins have knobby joints and skinny limbs, though a few are flabby or even roly-poly.  Their skin tone ranges from bright greens and oranges to dark, earthy browns.  Some are hairless, with oily hides, while others are covered in mangy hair from brow to back.  Many goblins ignore hygiene and are accompanies by an ever-present stink.  Some even take pride in their disgusting habits.
	Goblins wear whatever is available, usually incorporating small trinkets, trophies, or interesting things they've stolen in their travels.  These objects usually seem weird or pointless to others, who don't understand the value goblins place in these treasures.  A goblin's clothes are a patchwork of different materials stitched together over the course of years.  Its equipment is usually rusted or ramshackle but serviceable, thanks to goblin-kind's innate knack for tinkering.
	In theory a goblin's life span is equal to that of humans, but most goblins come to an early end because of their unbridled curiosity.</specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> In matters of belief in specific deities, following codes of conduct, or showing loyalty to a leader, goblins quickly get bored and move on.  They are motivated by novelties, be they stolen treasures or new sights and sounds, or even bodily sensations unique or bizarre.  Goblins live for sensation, going out of their way to explore, open, prod, taste, or rub up against new things-often to the disgust of non-goblin companions.
	Goblins' perceptiveness is curiously selective.  They might not notice hidden traps or monsters, but they latch onto weird old graffiti, bits of rotten food, scraps of ruined scrolls, and other interesting rubbish.  Living in an overpopulated warren teaches goblins that quantity is more important than quality.  A goblin would pass over one great treasure to grab a whole bunch of baubles.
	Goblin curiosity also drives them to pilfer and plunder.  They carry out raids and burglaries so they can acquire new things to take back to the warren.  However, goblins don't covet in the conventional sense.  Few maintain ownership of an item or value the trinkets they've collected.  They simply take what interests them at the moment, then discard it and move on to the next.  Their warrens are cluttered messes, overflowing with everything from golden treasure to shiny rocks.
	Many goblins are consummate schemers, concocting plans of startling complexity that they hope will generate excitement or riches.  Though few goblins are book smart, their devious minds can outpace those of other folk.  Goblins rarely think in ways that are linear or even logical.  They love investigating weird possibilities, improbable outcomes, and unlikely courses of action.  Such scheming sometimes triggers calamities that cascade like dominos-much to the goblins' delight.
	Goblns have few orthodox beliefs, but they love to create myths, rituals, and laws-most of which are arbitrary.  They imitate anything they think is neat, such as newly discovered customs of a nearby culture, although the original intent is usually lost in translation or warped to suit goblin ends.  Isolated goblin tribes in the deep wilds might hear the call of the primal spirits, though they might envision those spirits as unpleasant or slimy, such as Ska'nug the Skunk or Blhorgg the Whelk.

When creating a goblin adventurer, here are a few points to consider:
	*You're a social scoundrel.  Though goblins don't exactly look out for each other, they gain a feeling or independence and security when around their peers.  Your adventuring companions might fill the social void left since you departed the warren.  Their presense gives you the chance to brag and demonstrate your usefullness.  You are self-relient enough to survive the dangers of the world, but showing off when others are around to see is much more fun.
	*You're tricksy.  Goblins are fiendishly sneaky.  Few races can prowl or scheme as well as these pint-sized scoundrels, and even fewer can string together bluffs with such casual ease.  You might spend most of your time lurking behind the legs of your allies or in the shadows just out of sight.  On the other hand, you might also constantly tell outrageous fibs or exaggerated war stories to make yourself and your encounters sound more interesting.
	*You crave new experiences.  Goblins live for the novel.  You're at your happiest when reveling in some new treasure, food, or sensation-even unpleasant ones.  This desire encourages goblins to go out into the world, exploring and touching anything they can.  You might be obsessed with a particular type of object or feeling, or you might have left the tribe out of curiosity over what lies beyond the next horizon.  Either way, you are likely the first of your party to handle new items or prod something best left undisturbed.
	*You have a bad reputation.  The rest of the world sees goblins as pests and villains-with good reason.  The majority of your kind deserves their bad reputation, and facing discrimination will be a constant challenge.  You might be an enlightened goblin doing your best to show that not all of your kind is evil.  Perhaps you are as untrustworthy as the majority of your folk, but tempered somewhat by the influence of your adventuring companions.

	<!-- Svirfneblin Race -->
	<RulesElement name="Svirfneblin" type="Race" internal-id="ID_FMP_RACE_66" source="Dungeon Survival Handbook">
		<Prereqs> ~SVIRFNEBLIN </Prereqs>
		<Flavor> Subterranean gnomes dedicated to community who make strong bonds of friendship </Flavor>
		<specific name="Size"> Small </specific>
		<specific name="Speed"> 5 squares </specific>
		<specific name="Characteristics"> Proud, meek, lonely, curious, solemn, dour, cynical </specific>
		<specific name="Physical Qualities"> At a distance, svirfneblin look much like their surface-dwelling cousins but are distinguishable by their generally darker skin and gaunt bodies.  They have little body fat, which makes them appear emaciated.  They are very short, slightly smaller than surface gnomes, and stand no more than 3 1/2 feet tall.  Females are taller than their male counterparts, though males are often stockier.  Thought they appear frail, svirfneblin are just as heavy as other gnomes.  Their sturdy build results from the hard labor they undertake, which produces lots of muscle mass and a strong bone structure to support it.
	  A svirfneblin's appearance is also unique to its community's Underdark (or Feydark) region.  The skin color of deep gnomes varies according to the depth and location of their residences.  In places where mineral-rich soil has formed veins of gray and black stone, svirfneblin populations have a darker skin tone.  In areas where lava predominates, the gnomes' skin might display shades of maroon and brown.</specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Svirfneblin are content folk who enjoy hard work and love seeing the results of their strenuous labor.  Their close-knit community is central to their lives and an intrinsic part of their values: they maintain their discipline and will as long as their work serves the greater good.  They believe in shared sacrifice for the survival of the community.  Individual needs are rarely counted, a trait that leads svirfneblin to omit words such as &quot;I&quot; and &quot;my&quot; from their vocabulary even among family.  These words are foreign to their life experiences, and it takes them time to learn that other creatures single out one person as distinct from the people as a whole.
	Religion has an important place in deep gnome society.  Svirfneblin spend much time and perparation honoring the various gods they serve, and religion duties go to only the most respected and trusted among the clan.  The most prominent svirfneblin religious figure is Callarduran Smoothhands, the Master of Stone.  Outsiders, and many svirfneblin priests, believe Callarduran to be an exarch of Moradin, especially in the world of Abeir-Toril.  Most dwarves hold him to be a mask Moradin wears when speaking with the deep gnomes.  Svirfneblin legends tell that after the Dawn War, Callarduran gave the first free svirfneblin the resources they needed to live underground, and that he set prized stones deep within the rock.  Clerics of Callarduran often have the ability to summon and befriend elementals.
	A small number of svirfneblin rever Torog, the King that Crawls.  These worshippers can't live within a normal svirneblin community.  They either band together to form their own settlements far away from the others or join up with darker creatures of the Underdark, betraying their kin.

When creating a svirfneblin adventurer, here are a few points to consider:
	*You are a team player.  Whenever a problem arises, you always advocate for everyone to be involved in the solution.  You are eager to contribute your skills and knownledge to the discussion.
	*Strength in numbers.  An individual svirfneblin never confronts a physical threat alone unless forced.  You understand the intrinsic value of a coordinated group attack against a superior challenge.  You can help the team find the best way to tactically take down an opponent using all the resources available.
	*You know the depths better than anyone.  You know your way around the Underdark.  You might not like that fact, but it is true nonetheless.  Travelers, adventurers, and other Underdark denizens seek you out for your expertise.  Even if you don't know the exact path, you know the ever-changing landscape of the Underdark.  It is a living entity to you, and you understand how it lives, breathes, and operates.
	*Thanks for noticing.  You go about your life with pride in your people, your lineage, and your capabilities, but you can't shake the feeling that you aren't quite good enough.  Having deserted or been forced to leave your community and clan, no longer having a designated place in a social order, you might sense that you've lost your purpose.  This feeling might lead you to apologize for simple errors or go beyond the call of duty to prove yourself.  The simplest compliment could mean the world to you.

Veins of certain metals trap earth-friends, and sometimes svirfneblin miners free the little creatures.  A single earth-friend might serve a svirfneblin family for generations.  As long as it is left it its own devices most of the time, the creature allows itself to be summoned as a scout.

      <specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>
      <specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
      <specific name="Characteristics"> Brusque, courageous, disciplined, inspiring, meticulous, militaristic, pragmatic, proud, unforgiving </specific>
      <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Hobgoblins stand slightly taller than humans, though their military bearing makes them appear to tower over others more than their actual height would suggest. Hobgoblins are also more likely to wear heavier armor even when out of combat, giving them a stocky appearance. Their skin tone varies from dark yellow to brown, with brick-red or orange coloring being most common. Their hair is black or dark brown, and it frequently begins to go gray by the age of 30. Many hobgoblin males cultivate well-trimmed beards, though few grow mustaches with them.
Hobgoblin ears are long, pointed, and mobile. Although most hobgoblins have good control of their facial expressions, giving them a reputation for being emotionless, it's harder for them to keep their ears from lying back when they are upset or angry. Their shining yellow eyes and overdeveloped canines give them a wolflike appearance.
Hobgoblin males are taller and broader than females, but both sexes are capable of sustained physical activity. Hobgoblins can march for 20 miles per day over rough terrain for a week and still arrive in fighting condition at the end.
Hobgoblins' lives are slightly shorter than those of humans. Few hobgoblins live to be much older than seventy, and the rare hobgoblin who reaches eighty years or more is considered venerable and favored by luck and the gods. </specific>
      <specific name="Playing"> 
	Attitudes and Beliefs:
	There is no denying that hobgoblins are strict by the standards of most races. Those who make mistakes are punished swiftly, and poor excuses for dishonorable behavior are not tolerated. From a young age, hobgoblins are taught that untruths weaken the one who speaks them, making that individual unworthy of being trusted in the future. Conversely, a hobgoblin who takes responsibility for errors and accepts the punishment without flinching may receive some amount of acclaim for doing so.
Hobgoblins worship two gods above all others: Bane and his exarch Maglubiyet receive great respect within hobgoblin society. In particular, Bane's doctrine of seizing power over the undeserving is accepted unthinkingly by most hobgoblins.
The warriors in the ranks of a hobgoblin army typically have proficiency with shields and flails. The advocacy of "defense, and an offense that overcomes it" is an important part of the doctrine of hobgoblin warfare. The combination of flail and shield, aside from being effective on the attack, also provides a built-in defense against others turning the hobgoblins' weapons against them, since both items are difficult to use effectively without training. In addition, many hobgoblins are adept in using flails to strike around inexpertly wielded shields.
Hobgoblins greatly prefer being in control to any sense of indecision or chaos. This mind-set has led them to organize themselves and their kin, goblins and bugbears, into an orderly society in an attempt to civilize the wilderness. The thought of "untamed nature" is likely to cause a hobgoblin to curl a lip in distaste. The main exception to this attitude among hobgoblins is in the art of beast handling, where tamer is not necessarily better. Hobgoblins (and to a lesser extent, goblins) have reputations for being excellent riders, using horses and sometimes more exotic mounts such as dire tigers as steeds. These mounts cannot be considered domesticated, but the hobgoblins do know how to channel the creatures' aggression to work against the hobgoblins' foes. In this way, the mounts resemble the hobgoblins themselves-far from tame, but tightly controlling their behavior to achieve their goals.

	Hobgoblin History:
	Hobgoblins have a great deal of reverence for the history of their people, and hobgoblin loremasters hold an honored place within the clans. Due to their reliance on oral tradition, loremasters must have exceptional memories and exemplary honor, because any minor gloss or change could be passed down for generations. At the same time, most hobgoblins distrust written histories: Who can be certain who wrote them? This distrust has led to few histories being written down by hobgoblins, thereby indirectly justifying their point of view.
According to the loremasters, the hobgoblins were the first people from the natural world to cross into the Feywild. The people there were fractious and wild, attacking the hobgoblins' scouts. The clan chiefs realized that order would need to be imposed. The next scouting parties were better protected, and they focused on mapping out the corresponding sides of fey crossings. As the attacks on the scouts dropped off due to the improved defenses, the hobgoblin armies massed on the other side of the fey crossings. The fey creatures' lack of interest in the natural world proved to be their downfall when the hobgoblins invaded simultaneously from a variety of positions. This was the start of the hobgoblins' Feywild empire.
The hobgoblins' rule continued on for many generations, but the history grows vague during this era. Stories speak of brother turning against sister, the poisoned words of the fey whispered in their ears, until finally the empire split apart. The loss of their empire, along with the loss of face, continues to drive the revulsion that most hobgoblins feel toward elves and eladrin.
Since the fall of the empire, hobgoblins have spread out throughout the natural world, though some pockets still remain within the Feywild, fighting a guerrilla war against their foes. Every century or two since that time, a leader has arisen from one of the tribes, and this leader seeks to unite his or her people and reclaim past glory. These attempts have ended in failure-sometimes the unity lasts as long as a decade, but most such uprisings are put down within a couple of years.

	Hobgoblin Society:
	Hobgoblin society is organized into clans consisting of several extended families. Loyalty to one's clan comes first, then to the hobgoblin race, and then to the goblinoid races, including goblins and bugbears. That being said, much honor is accorded to those who balance these obligations, or better still, bring them to a common purpose. Even their greatest enemies cannot deny that hobgoblins have considerable ability in training and leading armies against their foes. These armies consist primarily of their goblin and bugbear cousins, as well as the hobgoblin officer corps and heavy cavalry, but on occasion include other races. Kobolds, ogres, and even bands of humans have all been part of hobgoblin armies.
From an early age, young hobgoblins are encouraged to determine their greatest strengths, and then make use of them. Although their society places more value on some kinds of jobs than others, it's better to do a less honored job well than to be merely mediocre at a more honored job. Those professions involved in producing-farming, mining, and the like-garner the least respect, and those involved in creating something- smithing, building, and so forth-gain more. The most honored professions are those relating to war and territorial expansion, so while a silversmith is respected, an armorer is revered. This means that most political leaders have been involved in the military, and no noble is separate from the other classes. Although the children of great leaders are more likely to have the opportunity to distinguish themselves (and thereby rise to the nobility themselves), such honor is by no means guaranteed-it must be earned.
Slavery is a fact of life in most hobgoblin societies, and many clans have at least a small number of slaves. Some of the people and other creatures that outsiders see as hobgoblin slaves are actually indentured servants, serving out ten- and twenty year terms. This practice is not done out of kindness. Rather, hobgoblins have found that most slaves provide poorer labor when they have no hope of freedom, and such slaves are also much more likely to try to escape or revolt. By giving their laborers a chance to earn their freedom earlier through good behavior, the hobgoblins see substantially better results and have cut down on slave revolts considerably. Indeed, they encourage servants to inform their masters of any revolts or escapes being planned in exchange for a reduction in their terms. In this way, they breed distrust, greatly reducing the likelihood of a large-scale slave uprising.
Hobgoblins' lives revolve around two kinds of honor, though "honor" is a poor translation from the original Goblin, which actually encompasses two words. Atcha is honor obtained through glorious deeds, such as the subjugation of new lands or the development of powerful new magic weapons and armor. Muut is honor obtained through doing one's duty well, whatever that duty is. Young hobgoblins focus on atcha when they jostle for rank among their peers, and this is encouraged to some degree by their parents and clan elders. But a common saying states that "A blade without a hilt cuts its wielder": a warning to those who seek atcha at the expense of muut that their failings will catch up with them one day.


	Hobgoblin Adventurers:
	Despite the strong pressure to conform within hobgoblin society, some hobgoblins rebel and leave their families and clans. Others are banished for a perceived weakness or personal failing, and still others believe that they will find atcha more easily by seeking out new lands alone. Even though they have left their society, their society never truly leaves them. These hobgoblins often seek to replace the void left by the loss of clan by bringing together a band of fellows.
	  
Bard
Hobgoblins' love for history and tales of martial combat lends itself to making them exceptional bards and skalds. Their words serve a key role in uniting goblin and bugbear tribes as parts of a hobgoblinled army. Their words are not the only things others should fear, however, because their fighting style draws upon all the greatest warriors in hobgoblin history.

Battlemind
Psionic powers are no more common among hobgoblins than they are in most other races. Hobgoblins who awaken their psionic potential and channel their wilder sides make excellent battleminds. Training with shields and heavier armor serves them well as they draw attackers away from vulnerable allies.

Blackguard
Although hobgoblins do not make great outward signs of faith as dwarves and elves do, their piety for their dark gods runs deep. The greatest reverence is expressed by those who draw upon the darkness of their own souls to weaken and overwhelm their foes. These blackguards have iron control of their own minds and bodies but sow the seeds of discord while they fight, turning ally against ally and kin against kin.

Warlord
The image of hobgoblin as warlord has been ingrained in the minds of civilized races after countless incursions. Whether they choose to focus on their tactical acumen or to inspire their comrades to fight all the harder, hobgoblins excel in leading at every level from small four- or five-person units all the way up to an army. Perhaps their greatest skill on the battlefield is ensuring that everyone maintains the proper position to gain the maximum tactical advantage. Few sights inspire such fear as ordered ranks of hobgoblins and their allies marching in perfect unison.	  
	  
When creating a hobgoblin adventurer, here are a few points to consider:
	  
* The lone wolf starves, but the pack feasts. 
You know that a single person going up against any real threat faces a grave disadvantage. After all, in a fair fight, you're just as likely to lose as to win. By joining a group, or better still, organizing one yourself, you become more capable of achieving your goals. It's your duty to ensure that the party is prepared for battle and to know what each member is capable of.

* The end can justify the means. 
It's not always pleasant, but you will do what it takes to get the job done. This isn't an excuse for cruelty without purpose. When the situation is grim and someone has to make the hard choice, you're the leader who steps forward and makes it. Let others keep their consciences clean. You're keeping them alive.

* Honor extends both ways. 
When you pledge yourself to follow another's banner, it is your duty to obey all orders to the best of your ability. When others pledge themselves to you, it is your duty to provide for them and use them to their best potential. These duties do not require mindless devotion from followers; honest opposition has its time and place. The people and the leader must work as one. </specific>

<!-- Winning Races: Bladelings Race -->
<RulesElement name="Bladeling" type="Race" internal-id="ID_FMP_RACE_38" source="Manual of the Planes, Dragon Magazine 419" revision-date="9/1/2010 3:23:26 PM">
      <Prereqs> ~BLADELING </Prereqs>
      <specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>
      <specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
      <specific name="Characteristics"> Calculating, cold, disciplined, domineering, focused, grim, severe, reserved, withdrawn </specific>
      <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Bladelings stand a bit taller than humans, and most have chiseled and athletic bodies. They weigh more than one might expect due to the dense, metallic nature of their skeletons and skin. Bladelings' coloration ranges from pale green to a dark, bruise-like purple. Many also have rust-colored freckles. A bladeling's eyes range from silver to pitch-black.
These qualities alone would not set bladelings apart from the countless humanoid variations encountered in the planes. What makes them distinct are the blades and spines that sprout from their flesh. The spurs on their brows and most of their bodies reach about a halfinch to an inch, while longer blades, typically growing on the shoulders and legs, can be more than two feet long. These blades grow continually, much like a fish's scales, and damage to or removal of one offers only the slightest discomfort to a bladeling. A broken spur crumbles to rust in a matter of minutes.
Through careful pruning and their innate ability to guide the blades' growth, bladelings can shape their appearance much as humans cut their hair or grow beards. A few of the more radical or antisocial individuals let their blades grow wild, hampering the use of most armor, but these are a minority. The average bladeling is more practical than that, preferring to cultivate shapes designed to impress or intimidate.</specific>
      <specific name="Playing">
	Attitudes and Beliefs:
	Bladelings wall off their emotions, presenting a stoic facade to everyone they meet. Dour and humorless, they approach even the most innocent situations with shrewd and calculating minds. Their ability to focus in complex and chaotic situations makes bladelings ideal soldiers, and their ingenuity helps them find the solution to almost any problem. Every bladeling sees the world through a strategist's eye and takes nothing lightly, not even idle conversation.	
Bladelings take pride in their fighting skills and have a hard time backing down from a challenge. No matter how slim the odds, no matter how desperate the situation, they acquit themselves without fear, coldly doing what must be done to emerge victorious. They believe in themselves foremost, not because they lack faith in their allies, but out of an almost pathological need to prove themselves capable. 
The bladelings' connection to Bane and the estrangement that persists between them and their maker give these people a perspective that poisons their views of all gods. They know that Bane shaped them to suit his purposes, but rather than seeing him as a benevolent creator, many bladelings have come to regard him as a tyrant, an opportunist, and a meddler. 
Even those with a more forgiving view can be cynical and suspicious when it comes to the divine powers, or anyone in authority for that matter. The few bladelings who do follow a divine path see their deities as partners in a mutually beneficial relationship, producing fewer clerics and more avengers among them.
Although the bladelings have largely parted from their maker, many remain in Bane's service. Those who still serve him regard the others as misguided rebels, while those who have escaped Bane's tyranny see their kin on Chernoggar as narrow-minded sycophants. Predictably, meetings between the different factions almost always end in violence.

	Forging of the Bladelings:
	The creation of the mortal world heralded the greatest war the cosmos has ever witnessed, pitting the gods of the Astral Sea against the primordials of the Elemental Chaos. Yet the Dawn War didn't ignite immediately. Chaotic and dispersed, the primordials did not immediately notice the gods' meddling with the middle realm. By the time the elemental lords mounted their assault, the world had already been blessed with some of the Astral Sea's stability, and life found what it needed to thrive. Whether spontaneously or through divine guidance, sentient beings arose there. And among those primeval mortals the gods found their first followers.
One such god was the stoic Achra, the Iron General, brother of cruel Tuern and thunderous Kord. Achra's martial teachings found purchase within a few primitive mortal tribes, providing them the tools to bring order into an age of anarchy. According to most scholars, these primitive mortals were humans. A few dissidents claim that they were actually from the same racial stock that would eventually give rise to the githyanki and githzerai. Whatever they were, these mortals became the first of Achra's followers, dedicated to his teachings of battle and strategy to an extent that rivaled even the god's angels. This dedication, coupled with their own mortal initiative and ingenuity, made them paragons of martial prowess. Through strength of arms, they tamed the wilderness around them and established some of the earliest city-states of the mortal world. So pleased was Achra with his worshipers that, when the Dawn War broke out, he offered them a place in his own divine legions.
When the gods' armies marched on the forces of the primordial Tabrach-Ti, the Queen of Bronze, they counted many of Achra's mortal followers among their numbers. It is said that the mortals fought with unmatched fervor and efficiency, slaying archons, elementals, and giants alike in the name of their divine general. As the battle reached its end, Achra slew the Queen of Bronze, the first primordial to die in the war, and was acclaimed as the General of Heaven by the other gods. His elemental enemies, on the other hand, began fearfully calling him by another name, which would identify him forevermore: Bane. And in this aspect the war god gazed approvingly upon his surviving mortal champions and elevated them to the status of favored servants.	
Quarrelsome and undisciplined as he was, Tuern was still a formidable opponent, and Bane needed soldiers to seize the iron fortress of Tuer-Chern. His angels were too evenly matched with those of his brother, but the Iron General had something Tuern lacked: his mortal champions. Through his divine power, Bane molded his favored servants into the perfect warrior race, melding them with the blades they used in battle. The war god gave each of them a body as strong as a greatsword and as agile as a flashing dagger. As their skin bonded with iron and steel, the mortals gained the ability to grow razors and spikes from their bodies. And knowing that a blade is only as strong as the thought that guides it-something his brother never seemed to grasp-the Iron General sharpened his followers' minds, granting them the willpower, insight, and determination to make them the perfect soldiers. Whatever they had been before, Bane's servants became an entirely new race. Pleased with his work, he christened his children bladelings, a name they carry to this day.
Tuern's forces were crushed underneath the boots of Bane's armies, and the Iron General was enthroned as the lord of Chernoggar. The bladelings considered themselves natives of the newly conquered domain, having shed their blood to win this homeland. They stood by Bane's side when the other gods united to discourage their lord from waging war against them. When one-eyed Gruumsh crashed his own domain of Nishrek into that of Bane, they fought valiantly to repel the orc hordes of the slaughter god.
Throughout these battles against Tuern and then Gruumsh, the bladelings followed the Iron General's every order. Devoted as they were to martial discipline, they had complete trust in their maker. But everything changed when the goblins came.

	Goblin Migration:
	Unknown to the bladelings, other worshipers of Bane began proselytizing among the hobgoblins of the middle world. The hobgoblins were resistant at first but eventually accepted the teachings of the Iron General to gain the upper hand against the more numerous goblins and the stronger bugbears. In what at first seemed to be another military excursion, Bane marched on the domain of the goblin god Maglubiyet. His absence left only the bladelings to keep Gruumsh's forces at bay. Perhaps the orc god knew of Bane's movements, for he mounted an overwhelming offensive against Tuer-Chern. Only through great sacrifice did the bladelings repel the assault. They fought fiercely, hoping to further prove themselves to the Iron General.
But the bladelings were appalled when Bane returned, with Maglubiyet in tow as his newest exarch and thousands of goblins migrating to settle in Chernoggar under his banner. The uncouth, unruly creatures brought chaos to the realm the bladelings had given so much to defend. And still the Iron General spoke of discipline and valor, even when the goblins knew nothing of these things. Like elder children replaced by younger, spoiled siblings, the bladelings grew resentful, and they began to yearn for independence from their dark god.

	Diaspora of Blades:
	A schism formed between the undisciplined goblins and Bane's veterans, who prided themselves on their loyalty, devotion to duty, and obedience to their maker. Dissent spread through the ranks of bladelings, eroding their dedication. In what some have come to call "Tuern's revenge," the bladelings began to question their creator's judgment, as if the original master of Tuer-Chern were still undermining his brother's authority. What had long been a monolithic force quickly fractured into several factions. Some remained loyal, remembering their vows to their master's cause. Others defied their maker and fled into Chernoggar's wilderness, where they would spend generations in hiding. Most left the dominion altogether, spreading out across the Astral Sea and beyond to find new lives for themselves free from oppression's yoke.
These emigrant bladelings were at first exhilarated by the prospect of exploring the cosmos and finally living on their own terms. Soon, though, the novice planewalkers chanced upon the planar metropolis of Sigil, the City of Doors. Although lacking the military structure of Tuer-Chern, Sigil's bladed battlements, ever-present razorvine, and acidic smog gave the city an eerie similarity to the bladelings' former home. Most of all, they were struck by the serene countenance of the Lady of Pain etched on arches and doorways. Seeing her bladed image as a sign, many bladelings decided to settle in the Cage.

	Bladeling Adventurers:
	Combat prowess and an innate thirst for glory make bladelings well suited to the adventuring life. They form the iron core of any adventuring group, reminding allies of their purpose and making everyone accountable for their actions. A bladeling's influence can transform the most willful band of individualists into an effective fighting unit with all the discipline of a military squad.
	
Avenger:
Few bladelings seek service to a god, seeing any such act as replacing one divine tyrant for another. Yet for all their skepticism about the gods, some recall the old tales with more than passing fondness and feel driven to pledge their swords to a cause higher than themselves. Such a bladeling enters a cautious arrangement with a god, agreeing to fight on his or her behalf in exchange for divine power.

Fighter:
Bane made the bladelings for one purpose: to fight. This nature remains, even though few bladelings have ties to the war god. Many of them become weaponmasters (see Dragon 398), usually favoring swords, spears, and similar weapons. Bladelings make exceptional brawling fighters.

Monk:
The militaristic roots of all bladelings are revealed in their discipline. Since they can control their warring emotions and achieve focus no matter the situation, bladelings are well suited to monastic traditions. Many seek out githzerai masters in the Elemental Chaos in hopes of attaining ultimate self-control. Bladeling monks favor the Centered Breath tradition.

Ranger:
Freed from Bane's service, many bladelings have spent centuries seeking a home in the infinite expanse of the Astral Sea. Some found new lives in service to factions, powers, and organizations, but many still roam the planes, searching for something to fill the hole left by their god's absence. These wanderers are well equipped to survive hostile environments, and they have developed skills and capabilities that make them exceptional scouts and hunters. Many bladeling rangers put these talents to use as bounty hunters and give chase to some of the most dangerous fugitives in the cosmos.

Runepriest:
Bladeling runepriests harness divine power without having to serve any god directly. They might not respect the gods, but they do appreciate their power, especially that gained from studying the Defiant Word and Serene Blade traditions. Bladeling runepriests sometimes work as master weaponsmiths and armorers, working to keep their fellows supplied with superior equipment. The arms and armor they produce are festooned with images memorializing fallen champions and grotesques depicting their enemies.
	  
When creating a bladeling adventurer, here are a few points to consider. 
	
* You live in Bane's shadow. 
You were molded by the gauntleted hand of the war god, and there's no denying your origins. You were born for war, but how do you face that predestination? You might embrace your warrior nature and block out all other aspects of your life, or you might search for a purpose outside the battlefield. But if you do fight, what do you fight for? 

* Your homeland is lost. 
Your people have no homeland to call their own. By leaving Chernoggar behind, you forfeited all claim your people had to it, and it now is overrun by goblins and orcs. Do you seek a new place you can belong to, or do you consider your own body to be your homeland?

* You are a child of the planes. 
You belong to the endless cosmos. As befits such a well-traveled race, you are used to seeing the big picture and putting things in perspective. You know that joy and pain, life and death are fleeting things, so you make the most of the present and try not to worry about what you can't control. </specific>

Their hair is fine and pale-usually platinum blond or white-and most of the males grow luxuriant beards and mustaches. Tinker gnomes' skin comes in varying shades of tan, and wrinkles develop at an early age.
When on the job or traveling, tinker gnomes prefer to wear heavily modified thick leather aprons festooned with all manner of small tools. A tinker gnome is always prepared to make improvements, no matter the situation. </specific>
		<specific name="Playing"> Here are a few points to consider when creating a tinker gnome character.
There is always a better way. Every task, no matter how mundane or minute, can be improved through study, industry, and creativity. Why use a mousetrap when you can design and build a Wind-Powered Troublesome Rodent Detection and Humane Extermination Automaton? True, the beta test version incinerated your cousin's foot, but that's a small price to pay for a rodent-free laboratory, and he seems to like his new Footmatic Pulley-Driven Prosthetic just fine (when it works, anyway).
Never forget your Lifequest. An important concept in tinker gnome society is the observance of the Lifequest. Every tinker has a Lifequest from birth, in addition to his or her normal duties and projects. Completion of the Lifequest safeguards the gnome and his or her bloodline, and it guarantees the gnome a place in the Afterlife. Lifequests are typically completed through the perfect development and understanding of a particular device. Few tinker gnomes have ever fulfilled a Lifequest.
Invention exists for the sake of invention. The prevailing sentiment within tinker gnome society is that creating a perfectly functioning device runs counter to the underlying principles of progress and advancement. A device that fulfills its task without complication or need for improvement is a creative dead end-anathema for most tinker gnomes. Those whose devices work regularly are often subjected to ridicule-or even exile in extreme cases. </specific>
		<specific name="Attitudes and Beliefs"> The need for innovation among tinker gnomes is legendary. Tinker gnomes think nothing of spending years-even decades-in the creation of complex (and often faulty) gadgets with no practical purpose. The creators of such devices seem to have little or no concern about safety in testing their dubious creations, and the results of such tests are sometimes fatal. Rare is the dedicated tinker gnome who lives to a ripe old age.
The majority of other races find tinker gnomes difficult to understand. Tinker gnomes speak quickly and endlessly, stringing together long sentences without care for natural pauses in the conversation or social cues. They feel that they have to race to complete their trains of thought before they are lost forever. More often than not, tinker gnomes end their sentences only after the listener verbally or forcibly instructs them to stop.
Tinker gnomes foster a love of bureaucracy that transcends even the most dedicated middlemen of other races and societies. Dozens-if not hundreds-of guilds, many of which feature overlapping areas of expertise, drive the tinker gnome settlements. If a tinker gnome cannot find a suitable guild for his or her branch of investigation, the gnome does not hesitate to found a new one-regardless of interest, need,
or purpose. 
Every tinker gnome has three names. The first name is the given name, which details the name and deeds of every member of the gnome's family tree. The second name is a shortened version, which merely points out the highlights of the family history. The third name is a nickname, usually bestowed upon the gnome by members of other races. The nickname usually consists of the first few syllables of the gnome's full name. Most gnomes find these nicknames to be a mild indignity, but those who have regular dealings with other races tolerate their use.
The patron deity of the tinker gnomes is Reorx, the Creator. But the tinker gnomes are not especially religious, so they pay their deity little more than lip service, except for the observance of the Lifequest (see below). Tinker gnome priests do exist, but they are few and far between. </specific>
		<specific name="Tinker Gnome Communities"> More than ninety-five percent of all tinker gnomes on Krynn dwell in a single dormant volcano. The gnomish name for the volcano is nearly a hundred words long, and most other races cannot pronounce it at all. Therefore, it has earned the sobriquet Mount Nevermind. The Naming Guild insists that this nickname was the utterance of an early human visitor to the settlement, who shouted "Never mind!" after a friendly member of the Greeting Guild attempted to welcome the beleaguered man to the mountain.
Tinker gnomes occasionally visit or even dwell in human cities, though most humans who live near them take great pains to limit their need for redesigning items, since such well-meaning endeavors can result in the malfunction or even destruction of useful devices. Some tinker gnomes also make their homes in predominantly kender and dwarven communities, though the gnomes tend to isolate themselves within their own enclaves.</specific>
		<specific name="Tinker Gnomre Adventurers"> Most tinker gnomes prefer to stay within their own enclaves, researching their next projects. A few, however, find the adventuring life a useful means of discovering new research topics, as well as of field testing prototype equipment.
Artificer: The artificer is the default adventuring class of the tinker gnome. Innovation and fabrication are the tinker gnome's strongest suits, and the path of artifice is the perfect expression of these and other creative endeavors.
Bard: Though tinker gnomes are not musical by nature, it cannot be denied that the bardic pursuit of knowledge across many and varied areas of study is, for them, an attractive notion. Bardic tinker gnomes often neglect other aspects of their chosen profession in favor of becoming the ultimate polymath. Ironically, most gifted tinker gnome bards avoid the Music-Making Guild and its experimental melodic stylings.
Rogue: Curiosity drives innovation, and satisfying that curiosity occasionally requires a larcenous skill set. The Acquisitions Guild is essentially a Thieves' Guild for tinker gnomes, tasked with procuring materials and goods, or even funding for new projects. For this reason, many guilds find it in their best interest to turn a blind eye to common acts of "acquisition," and the roguish professions are considered to be an acceptable option for young tinker gnomes.
Wizard: The study of wizardry features its own particular specialty of cleverly made devices, and it is only natural that magic-minded tinker gnomes often choose this profession. </specific>

No one is precisely sure where tinker gnomes originated, since most of their earliest records were destroyed in a fire resulting from dubious experiments in advanced record-keeping technology. Despite this event, most tinker gnomes insist that they can trace the personages and events surrounding their family lines all the way back to their creation by the god Reorx. This assertion suggests that entire swaths of tinker gnome history are the product of sheer invention. To anyone who knows tinker gnomes, such a hypothesis seems a strong possibility.
	Tinker gnomes are industrious to the extreme, exhibiting an obsessive need to build and redesign devices to help with every facet of their hectic lives. These gnomes challenge the limits of their world's scientific and magical knowledge on a daily basis. The average tinker gnome generally regards those few members of the race who are uninterested in technology as either lazy or insane, since satisfaction with the status quo and reliance on mundane solutions is nearly unheard of in tinker gnome society.
	Though all tinker gnomes have a penchant for invention and engineering, relatively few are truly gifted in this area. The bulk of gnomish experimentation relies on trial and error, and most gnomes cheerfully acknowledge that the majority of their efforts end in failure. This fact does not disturb them, however; they are always ready to move onward to their next pet project.

Tinker gnomes have a natural talent for fixing, altering, or even disabling mechanical gadgets-usually through elaborate, if hurried, modification. The modified object might not look anything like it did before undergoing the gnome's enthusiastic ministrations, but it gets the job done.
