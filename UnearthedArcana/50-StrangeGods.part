Once per encounter you can invoke divine power, filling yourself with the might of your patron deity. With the divine might you invoke you can wield special powers. You can also learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the divinity feats grant characters with access to the Channel Divinity class feature the ability to use additional special powers.
Regardless of how many different uses for Channel Divinity you know, you can use only one such ability per encounter. The special ability or power you invoke works just like your other powers.

	<specific name="Creating a Ghost"> 
Ghosts join new or established adventuring groups for a variety of reasons. You can use any of the following examples as your character's motivation for joining the group, or create one of your own.

	* Haunted Item: Many ghosts haunt particular locations, but some instead have a connection to certain objects. You have a psychic bond with an item a player character carries. You might have owned this item in life, created the item, or been slain by it. Something about the item, or the character who now owns it, stirred your spirit into consciousness. You follow the item wherever it goes and are loath to let it out of your sight.
	
	* Vanquished Enemy: You are the ghost of someone the player characters killed. Perhaps you have no recollection of how you died, but you know the adventurers are important to you in some way. Or you might remember them and seek to make amends for your misdeeds and villainy. This option is a strong choice if you're joining a well-established party. The characters could be slow to trust you, though-if they do so at all. Although such tension can help create memorable roleplaying scenes, this option might not be appropriate for all groups.
	
	* Watchful Relation: You have a connection to a living player character. You might be a parent, sibling, or family friend, and you feel a responsibility to watch over the character and offer advice, protection, and assistance. The person could have a special destiny, be committed to completing a quest you began when you were alive, or simply be someone you loved a great deal.</specific>
	<specific name="Becoming a Ghost"> 
Converting an existing character to a ghost is an excellent option when being raised from the dead is not possible. Not every being comes back as a ghost, however, so you should work with your DM to come up with a suitable reason. The following examples are intended as starting points.
	When you rise as the ghost of a dead character, you appear in an unoccupied space nearest to where you died, at a time of the DM's choosing. Manifestation can be instantaneous, or it can take hours, days, or even years.

	* Dazed and Confused: Sudden, unexpected death can cause the soul to become disoriented, unwilling to believe it has died. You might linger for a time as a ghost until you come to terms with your demise. Your spirit might persist for one adventure or several.
	
	* Unfinished Business: Player characters might become ghosts if they die before completing an important quest. Your commitment to the cause is too great to let death stop you. Your status as a ghost lasts only until the quest is complete; then you move on.
	
	* Dark Circumstances: Unusual situations can give rise to a character's transformation into a ghost. For example, if you died on the Shadowfell, your soul might have become suffused with shadow energy. A vile spell might have ripped your soul from your body before death took you. Perhaps a curse barred your soul from its ultimate fate, dooming you to restless eternity unless you can find a way to escape or overcome the wicked magic.</specific>
	<specific name="Playing a Ghost"> 
Even in a world populated with crystal beings, demon spawn, and minotaurs, ghosts are scary. They remind people of their own mortality. With your deathly, ethereal form and odd behavior, you can expect screams instead of greetings wherever you go.
	Your appearance is disturbing. The connections that bind you to the world also influence your physical appearance. As a newly formed ghost, you look much as you did during the last moments of life. You might sport horrific wounds, appear old and haggard, have a face frozen in a rictus of pain or terror, or otherwise demonstrate the cause of your death. Your memories manifest the clothing you wore in life, including armor and jewelry, and you carry the same equipment, albeit wispy and ethereal. After a time, you learn to distance yourself from your death and can assume a less disturbing appearance.
	You remember-mostly. Just as you physically resemble your living form, so too do you retain your normal mannerisms, at least for a while. Your personality, morals, goals, and objectives might remain as they did in life, though being dead can render certain motivations less important. For example, physical wealth no longer has the practical appeal that it does to the living. Your memory is fuzzy at best, so you might forget small details, the names of other characters, locations, or specific events.
	You are plagued by visions. Becoming a ghost is traumatic, both as a result of dying and because of what you encounter on the other side. You stand in two worlds and might experience strange visions while in this state if your DM so chooses. They could be mere hallucinations, or they might be messages from other trapped spirits.
	You can play up your distraction from these visions, perhaps looking around as if you saw something out of the corner of your eye, or laughing or grunting as if in response to someone speaking. </specific>
	<specific name="Ghost Traits"> 
To make a new ghost, create a character as normal and then apply the following traits. If an existing character becomes a ghost, modify his or her statistics by applying these ghost traits.
	As a ghost, you retain all the racial traits, class features, and powers you had in life. The ghost traits gained last only as long as you remain a ghost and are lost if you return to life.
	
	* Maximum Hit Points: Reduce your maximum hit points to your bloodied value. Then, recalculate your bloodied value from your new maximum hit point total.
	
	* Healing Surges: Your number of healing surges becomes 2.
	
	* Senses: You have darkvision.
	
	* Ghostly Presence: You have a +4 racial bonus to Stealth checks.
	
	* Undead: You are not a living creature. Effects that specifically target living creatures do not work on you. You do not eat, drink, breathe, or sleep. You are also immune to disease.
	
	* Insubstantial: You take half damage from all attacks, except those that deal force or psychic damage.
	
	* Limited Phasing: You ignore difficult terrain. In addition, you can move up to 1 square into a solid object large enough to accommodate a creature of your size. While in an object, you can move only if you leave the object; you have line of sight and line of effect to no creature, and no creature has line of sight or line of effect to you.
	
	* Rejuvenation: When you drop to 0 hit points or fewer, your ghostly form dissolves into ectoplasm, a residue some incorporeal creatures leave behind when they touch objects or are destroyed. You are removed from play. If you have any healing surges to spend, you can do so at the end of a short rest, reappearing with the appropriate number of hit points. Otherwise, at the end of each hour, make a saving throw. If you succeed, you reappear with your full normal hit points. In any case, when you reappear, you do so in the space you last occupied or the nearest unoccupied space to it of your choice.
	
	* Equipment: Upon becoming a ghost, your memory creates insubstantial versions of the equipment you carried when you were alive. If you drop any of these items or give one to another creature, the item loses coherency and dissolves into ectoplasm. As a standard action, you can re-create that item so it rejoins your possessions. You cannot pick up or manipulate physical objects, so you cannot add new items to your equipment or benefit from them. You can, however, benefit from alternative rewards that do not take physical forms.
	
	* Inherent Bonuses: You use the fixed enhancement bonus (inherent bonus) system described in Dungeon Master's Guide 2 and the Dark Sun Campaign Setting.
	
	* Powers: You retain all the attack powers and utility powers you had when you were alive. Your ghostly state imposes a few modifications to how you use these powers.
		-Attacks: Any power you know that normally targets AC instead targets Reflex. You take a -2 penalty to attack rolls using such powers.
		-Damage: Whenever you would deal untyped damage, you instead deal necrotic damage or psychic damage (your choice).</specific>
	
	<specific name="The Next Step">	
The novelty of being a ghost is bound to wear off. At some point you must decide whether to move on to whatever awaits your soul, return to the world of the living, or linger as a ghost. 
	
	* Back among the Living: 
	If you plan to return to life, you need your body, preferably intact. Raise Dead requires at least part of a corpse, for example. Time is also a factor; most magic can affect only the recently dead, though a Gentle Repose ritual can preserve your flesh (and prevent unwanted animation). It's always a good idea to keep your body safe and secure until you can gather the resources to come back from the dead.
	Upon your return, you remember your existence as a ghost. In game terms, this means you keep any experience points you earned, as well as levels, feats, and race or class powers you gained. You lose all ghost traits, powers, and features.
	
	*Lingering On: 
	If you intend to remain a ghost, your body can be a significant liability. A diabolic necromancer who finds your corpse might animate it as a mindless undead horror. Some rituals might use body parts to summon ghosts or compel them to reveal information. Unless you have the means to animate and control your own corpse, your best solution might be to destroy it.
	Your ghostly existence continues for a time, but nothing lasts forever. Eventually, your memories fade until you cannot remember anyone or anything from your life. Your values, your beliefs, and finally your personality evaporate. If you don't leave the earthly realm, you will eventually become an undead monster under the DM's control, fated to wander endlessly until ultimately destroyed.</specific>

Any mortal creature might become a ghost. Adventurers have reported encounters with ghostly hounds whose barking and baying chill the bone. Others have run across the shades of beautiful elf maidens, so tormented by their undead state that their shrieks can stop a beating heart. Even horrific monsters such as beholders might rise in ghostly form.
	Still, extraordinary circumstances are required for a soul to refuse Letherna's call and linger in the world. Often, a disembodied spirit resists moving on due to unfinished business in life: a crucial quest unfulfilled, a responsibility not upheld, a duty not honored. Like anchors, these memories weigh on the ghost and force it to remain, at least until whatever troubles it has been resolved.
	The Shadowfell can also form ghosts from the newly dead. Shadow's subtle influence can awaken memories, emotions, and sensations that quicken the spirit and prevent it from finding peace. Ghosts twisted by such power grow to resent and even hate the living, and in time they might lose all traces of their mortal existence, becoming vengeful wraiths.
	Finally, rare individuals with strong personalities, great magical power, or an extraordinary ability can cheat death through sheer force of will. They refuse to move on, unmoved by the Raven Queen's demands. Such ghosts are the most powerful and feared of their kind, for they go wherever and do whatever they please.
	Regardless of the reasons for their formation or the powers they possess, all ghosts gradually fade away. The longer a ghost remains, the more tenuous its hold becomes on who it was. Memories disappear. Familiar faces become strangers. Important places lose their prominence. As the centuries pass, more and more of the ghost's identity is lost, until it forgets its former life and knows only its undead existence.
	All ghosts are hard to kill, coalescing into their former shape hours or days after their apparent destruction. The only way to put a ghost to rest for certain is to finish whatever task binds it to the world. Even then, some ghosts refuse to move on. The more baleful spirits might be banished only by breaking their connection to the Shadowfell, or by overcoming the magic that defies death's call.

    <Flavor> The potential to become a ghost lies in every mortal creature-even adventurers. Death not need be an end for your character; it can be a beginning. Whether you want to continue the story of a living adventurer who fell afoul of a monster's attack, a trap, or some other peril, or play a character from beyond the grave who joins forces with the living, the rules presented here let you explore the world from a new perspective, between the living and the dead. </Flavor>

To make a new ghost, create a character as normal and then apply the following traits. If an existing character becomes a ghost, modify his or her statistics by applying these ghost traits.
	As a ghost, you retain all the racial traits, class features, and powers you had in life. The ghost traits gained last only as long as you remain a ghost and are lost if you return to life.
