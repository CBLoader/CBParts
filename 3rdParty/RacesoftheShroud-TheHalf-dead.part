    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Members of any race can find themselves among the half-dead. The half-dead's original race is still recognizable on some level, but all half-dead lose their original racial qualities and undergo the same changes. In appearance, all half-dead resemble a recently deceased version of their original race, but the specifics vary greatly among individuals. A half-dead's skin becomes a sickly pale color, often splotched with purple from the pooling blood from their semi-functional circulatory system. As they age, they become increasingly gaunt, no matter how much food they eat. After a few years they look to be perpetually starving. Their faces become sunken, tight-stretched masks with little expression. Some half-dead conceal their nature with makeup or clothing that conceals. However, their milky, blank eyes never can be hidden short of magic. This gives them a lost, haunted gaze that never seems to focus on anything at least anything in the land of the living. Many of the half-dead's bodily functions, such as hair growth or healing of injuries, stopped when they left the ranks of the fully living. Each half-dead is unique. Which processes continue differs among individual cases. Some are able to grow hair but cannot heal without scarring. Others quickly lose their teeth to rot but continue growing fingernails without a problem. All half-dead eventually smell like a graveyard, never quite rotting but giving the impression something is not right within them. This half life makes it difficult for the halfdead to conceal their true natures, the longer they exist.</specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> The half-dead are drawn from all races, professions, and people among the Shroud, but they all have one thing in common: they were not willing to lie down and die. Without exception, all half-dead died with some great feat left unaccomplished. Their drive to finish this task and the power of the Shroud have given them a second chance. Thus half-dead are all driven, willful sorts who have the power to fight back death. Resolving a quest does not release a half-dead. Indeed, even when others have taken up the half-dead's lost quests and brought them closure, the half-dead continues to exist. Death is the only real escape from this half-life. Once the halfdead are returned to the land of the living, at least in part, they can only leave by dying again. Some half-dead are driven mad by this realization, having found no comfort in closure. There is no peace in this world for the half-dead, save what they make. Generally, all half-dead have the personality, cultural knowledge, and memories of their living existence, though most now see these beliefs through a dark and sardonic filter. The great causes they valued in life often look pale and empty through the eyes of the dead. Many half-dead are deeply sarcastic, cynical, and bitter people. Some manage to find new causes and beliefs to champion, but most avoid placing too much faith in anything but themselves. More than a few half-dead lose faith in their gods, who (the half-dead reason) must have abandoned them to this half-life rather than letting them rest in peace. Some of the half-dead try to reinsert themselves back into their old lives, but this rarely works. Few people are comfortable around the half-dead, especially when it's a husband, mother, or friend. This drives most half-dead to seek out new homes; often their search never ends due to the widespread fear and violence that greets them. Many people cannot differentiate between a halfdead and an undead, and angry mobs have executed more than a few well-meaning half-dead due to such confusion. Many half-dead live as hermits, wandering adventurers who conceal their true nature, or who reside among the more spiritual tribes of the Ghostcrag Peaks. where consorting with the dead is not such an issue. Many of the half-dead show a strange affinity for the ancient ruins scattered across the Ghostcrag Peaks. They explore and research these ancient and little known remains of an elder civilization. Some go mad in this pursuit. Others pay the mystery little mind aside from a quick investigation. Theories about this affinity to these mountainous ruins abound. Some believe that the energy animating the half-dead is the essence of the spirits of this long dead civilization, whereas others think the Shroud itself directs them to find something in these ancient ruins. </specific>
