      <specific name="Creating"> The deathwarden has two basic builds: the channeling deathwarden and the portal deathwarden. All deathwardens depend on Wisdom for their attack powers. Channeling deathwardens gain additional benefits from Constitution, while portal deathwardens gain secondary bonuses from Intelligence. </specific>
      <specific name="Class Features"> You have the following class features. </specific>
	  <specific name="Supplemental"> RITUAL BOOK
You possess a ritual book, and it contains two rituals you have mastered: the Gentle Repose ritual and one other 1st-level ritual of your choice. You are able to take Alchemist formulas in place of standard rituals if desired. </specific>
      <specific name="Implement">By spending one hour ritually preparing a chosen light or heavy shield, you attune it to you and your connection to the boundary between life and death. You can only be attuned to one shield at any one time. Attuning a new shield immediately breaks your attunement to any other shields. </specific>
	  <specific name="Near-Death Projection"> You are able to enter a death-like trance once per encounter by spending a healing surge as a standard action. You must be able to spend a healing surge to use this ability. While you are using Near-Death Projection, you are blinded and deafened. Your soul floats out of your body, and as a move action, you can move your soul a number of squares equal to your Wisdom modifier. Your soul is immaterial, can pass through solid objects, and cannot be affected by or affect any creatures or objects. You can see, hear, and make Perception checks as if your body was in the square your soul currently occupies. You do not need to have line of effect between the location of your soul and your body.
At the end of each turn in which you are using Near-Death Projection, you must make a Wisdom ability check to continue using this class feature. If you fail this check, or choose to return your soul to your body, your soul returns to your square and you are no longer blinded and deafened. The DC for this check starts at 10 and increases by 5 after each turn in which you use Near-Death Projection.</specific>
      <specific name="Warden's Intervention"> Choose one of the following two benefits.
Channeling Intervention. Whenever an ally within 5 squares of you becomes bloodied, as an immediate reaction you can grant that ally a power bonus equal to your Constitution modifier to all defenses until the end of that ally's next turn. Whenever an enemy within 5 squares of you causes one of your allies to drop to 0 hit points or below, you can add your Constitution modifier to the next damage roll made by you or one of your allies against that enemy before the end of your next turn.
Portal Intervention. Whenever an ally within 5 squares of you becomes bloodied, as an immediate reaction you can grant that ally temporary hit points equal to one-half your level plus your Intelligence modifier. Whenever an ally within 5 squares of you drops to 0 hit points or below, as an immediate reaction you can move a number of squares equal to your Intelligence modifier toward that ally. </specific>

Deathwardens are defensive leaders who guard the boundary between the world of the living and the afterlife. They bring woe to their enemies and benefit their allies by channeling the aspects of death that wait to claim the souls of mortals when they die, and by opening portals to the extra-planar realms that are the final destination of those souls. Deathwardens are devoted to preserving the lives of their comrades, who might be resolute exemplars of good or depraved followers of evil.
		You took your first steps toward becoming a deathwarden when you realized that you could detect the presence of impending death. You might have been a child who grew bold enough to talk to the shadow only you could see in the hut of a dying villager, or an acolyte who honed your mystic senses by taking doses of poisons that brought you ever closer to death's veil. This unique sensitivity to the forces of mortality affects each deathwarden differently. Some become morbid, turning grim and gloomy or reveling in the blackest of gallows humor. Others find their appetite for the good things in life is whetted by the knowledge that the end is always near. Your vigilance at the threshold between life and death gives you great powers, as well as a constant reminder of life's fleeting nature and inevitable end. What legendary deeds will you seek to achieve in the time allotted to you?

By spending one hour ritually preparing a chosen light or heavy shield, you attune it to you and your connection to the boundary between life and death. You can only be attuned to one shield at any one time. Attuning a new shield immediately breaks your attunement to any other shields. You gain the following benefits with an attuned shield:
- You can use the attuned shield as an implement when you use a deathwarden power or a deathwarden paragon path power.
- If the attuned shield is a magic item, when you are wielding it you gain an enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls with powers that have the implement keyword. When you score a critical hit with an attack that is delivered through your attuned shield, you gain a number of extra d6 of damage equal to its enhancement bonus. This enhancement bonus is determined by the level of the attuned magic shield.

If the attuned shield is a magic item, when you are wielding it you gain an enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls with powers that have the implement keyword. When you score a critical hit with an attack that is delivered through your attuned shield, you gain a number of extra d6 of damage equal to its enhancement bonus. This enhancement bonus is determined by the level of the attuned magic shield. Without an implement, a deathwarden can still use these powers, but he or she doesn't gain the bonus provided by the magic implement.

You are able to enter a death-like trance once per encounter by spending a healing surge as a standard action. You must be able to spend a healing surge to use this ability. While you are using Near-Death Projection, you are blinded and deafened. Your soul floats out of your body, and as a move action, you can move your soul a number of squares equal to your Wisdom modifier. Your soul is immaterial, can pass through solid objects, and cannot be affected by or affect any creatures or objects. You can see, hear, and make Perception checks as if your body was in the square your soul currently occupies. You do not need to have line of effect between the location of your soul and your body.
At the end of each turn in which you are using Near-Death Projection, you must make a Wisdom ability check to continue using this class feature. If you fail this check, or choose to return your soul to your body, your soul returns to your square and you are no longer blinded and deafened. The DC for this check starts at 10 and increases by 5 after each turn in which you use Near-Death Projection.

The deathwarden has two basic builds: the channeling deathwarden and the portal deathwarden. All deathwardens depend on Wisdom for their attack powers. Channeling deathwardens gain additional benefits from Constitution, while portal deathwardens gain secondary bonuses from Intelligence.
Choose one of the following two benefits.
Channeling Intervention. Whenever an ally within 5 squares of you becomes bloodied, as an immediate reaction you can grant that ally a power bonus equal to your Constitution modifier to all defenses until the end of that ally's next turn. Whenever an enemy within 5 squares of you causes one of your allies to drop to 0 hit points or below, you can add your Constitution modifier to the next damage roll made by you or one of your allies against that enemy before the end of your next turn.
Portal Intervention. Whenever an ally within 5 squares of you becomes bloodied, as an immediate reaction you can grant that ally temporary hit points equal to one-half your level plus your Intelligence modifier. Whenever an ally within 5 squares of you drops to 0 hit points or below, as an immediate reaction you can move a number of squares equal to your Intelligence modifier toward that ally.

 You store your rituals in a Necronomicon. The Necronomicon contains two rituals you have mastered: Gentle Repose and Memento Necromantica. A typical Necronomicon can hold up to 50 rituals. You are able to take Alchemist formulas in place of standard rituals if desired. </specific>
	  <specific name="Harness Death"> Once per encounter you can invoke the power of Death, using it to command the dead and ward off your own demise. Some necromancers learn other uses for this feature; for instance, the Harness Death feats  grant characters with access to the Harness Death class feature the ability to use additional special powers.</specific>
      <specific name="Bag of Bones"> You may collect a trophy as a minor action if you are adjacent to a dead body: a bone, finger, claw, tooth, or similar small part. You must collect the trophy within 1 hour of the creature's death. Make a note of the origin and type of creatures you kill. You might make a note indicating "unicorn: horn of fey magical beast." Players are strongly encouraged to keep accurate records of their kills and trophies. Using the ritual, "Memento Necromantica" you can transform the trophy into a token that can be used to power your Harrowings (Spells). </specific>
	  <specific name="Death Mark"> The necromancer may mark a foe. When that foe reaches zero hit points, the necromancer may activate a healing surge on his next turn. </specific>
	  <specific name="Acolyte of Darkness"> Necromancers are usually a mixture of both priest and mage, and often call upon the dark forces of various evil deities to grant them boons against their enemies.

Necromancers are masters of the forces of death. Necromancers act as a conduit to the energies of the plane of shadows, using necrotic blasts and bursts to destroy and wither their foes, summon and create undead, and terrify those who are weak of mind. They slay their enemies, and then raise their corpses as undead slaves. Necromancers channel the power of decay and plague through their death masks and scythes, spreading death and disease in their wake.
	You defy death, laughing in the face of mortality and mortal rules. You could be a sage of dark and dangerous knowledge, the creator of an undead army, or a spurned academic who experiments with forbidden magic. Not all necromancers are evil, though all walk a fine line. Some serve the greater good, using their macabre powers for a higher purpose, even if many consider their methods distasteful.
	The power of the plane of shadows follows you like a trail of darkness. Forbidden rituals let you tap into taboo powers, and you use your implement as a reminder not to cross you. The power of unlife excites you, but you challenge its limits. Will you control it or will it control you?

You may collect a trophy as a minor action if you are adjacent to a dead body: a bone, finger, claw, tooth, or similar small part. You must collect the trophy within 1 hour of the creature's death. Make a note of the origin and type of creatures you kill. You might make a note indicating "unicorn: horn of fey magical beast." Players are strongly encouraged to keep accurate records of their kills and trophies. Using the ritual, "Memento Necromantica" you can transform the trophy into a token that can be used to power your Harrowings (Spells).

You have made a pact with the departed.

Whether you are the last survivor of a lost and forgotten people, the servant of a secret order long extinguished, or the keeper of the ghostly remnant of a deposed and murdered king, your power and your purpose come from your willingness to listen to the whispers of the dead and to channel their essence into a small semblance of the life they once knew.
Take up the sword of your ancestors, and gird yourself with the souls of warriors long dead. It is not simply your sworn duty, but your destiny!

      <specific name="Supplemental"> Assassin Overview

Characteristics: You can turn into an insubstantial creature of shadow. While you are in that form, even the most alert sentinel can overlook your approach, and attacks pass through you with little harm. When you spot your target, you study its weaknesses as you prepare to deliver a killing blow.

Religion: Assassins who pursue evil creatures are often worshipers of the Raven Queen, who teaches that death is the great leveler, a tool the world needs to end abuses by powerful beings. Evil assassins wallow in the misery and fear they cause, or they revel in performing an exquisite kill. Such folk usually venerate Zehir or Lolth.

Races: Revenants have the combination of implacability and physical ability needed to flourish as assassins. Half-orcs also excel as assassins, often having a brutish nature that makes the assassin's art palatable to them. Drow are superlative assassins, both because they grow up in a society that values skilled murder and because they are comfortable with working in darkness. Halflings make good assassins since they can combine their natural stealthiness with a native curiosity that makes hiding from them difficult. Changeling assassins possess an unsurpassed ability to infiltrate and kill from a position of trust.

Assassins and the Ki Focus
Assassins use ki focuses for the ability to augment mundane weapons. After all, a guard patrol is far more suspicious of the wanderer carrying a greatsword than of the unarmed peasant. Using ki focuses, assassins wield whatever weapons are at hand, or even unarmed strikes, to deliver shadow attacks.

When you use your ki focus with a weapon attack, you focus shadow magic into your weapon. Some assassins carry a few different weapons to ensure that they have the right tool for the job. An accurate weapon, such as a longsword, is a good tool for taking down a heavily armored warrior. When an assassin battles a brute that relies on endurance rather than defense, a less accurate but devastating weapon such as a greataxe proves useful.
	
Since your ki focus augments your basic attacks, a thrown weapon wielded in your off hand serves as the perfect complement to your primary weapon. You can throw a dagger to cut down a fleeing guard, and feats such as Two-Weapon Fighting improve your melee abilities. </specific>
      <specific name="Implement"> Assassins focus their shadow energy through a ki focus, which is not an object they wield but a reservoir of magical power within themselves. When using a ki focus, an assassin taps into the power of shadow magic and channels it into both implement and weapon attacks.

You can imbue your ki focus with magic as if it were a physical implement. When you have a magic ki focus, you can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of assassin powers and assassin paragon path powers that have the implement keyword. You can also add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of any weapon attack you make using a weapon with which you're proficient.

You can also use a weapon with which you're proficient as an implement. While wielding the weapon as an implement, the characteristics of the weapon you use - proficiency bonus, damage die, and weapon properties (such as defensive or high crit) - are irrelevant to your implement powers.

If you have a magic ki focus and wield a magic weapon, you choose before you use an attack power whether to draw on the magic of your ki focus or to employ the magic of your weapon. Your choice determines which enhancement bonus, critical hit effects, and magic item properties and powers you can apply to attacks with that power. You can't, for example, use the enhancement bonus of your ki focus and the property of your magic weapon with the same attack power. </specific>
      <specific name="Powers"> Your powers are called hexes. They draw on your shadowed soul to enhance your combat techniques or harm your enemies directly. You can use shadows as distractions, weapons, and secret paths to destroy your enemies. </specific>

Few creatures embrace shadow magic without both a compelling reason and a measure of desperation. Not many visit the Shadowfell willingly, let alone pledge a shard of their souls to it. Yet that is exactly what assassins, and other practitioners of shadow magic, do to gain their power.

As an assassin, you cede a portion of yourself to the Shadowfell, replacing a fundamental part of your being with a dark reflection of your true self. At times, you can manifest this twisted image in place of your body so that you can face attacks with little cause for concern. Also, the infusion of shadow magic allows you to spot the weakest points in a victim's defenses. With a few moments of study, you can reduce even the stoutest warrior to a corpse.

If others know that you are an assassin, you might find that few trust you. In some civilized realms, the study of shadow magic and assassination is banned on pain of death. In the past, and as a response to the outcry against them, assassins formed coteries, or guilds, of like-minded slayers, and each one delves into the study of shadow magic and develops unique methods of killing. A guild provides you with a measure of protection, and its grandmasters expect obedience and fealty. The wars between guilds, and the struggles within them, might never spill into mass battles, but they still leave dozens of slain folk in their wake.

As an assassin, you are an outcast. You traded away part of your soul for the power of death. Perhaps you seek justice against a powerful enemy, or maybe you had no other way to preserve yourself in the face of a bleak, uncaring world. Whatever drew you onto the assassin's path, you are an avatar of death and a trained killer from whom few can escape unharmed.

You guide your party to victory by taking on the attributes of the soul conductors who stand just beyond the veil of death, waiting to bring souls to their final resting place. You stand fast in the thick of battle, and when the need arises, you can take on the role of a defender as well as a leader. Wisdom should be your highest ability score for the sake of your attack powers. Constitution should be your next highest score, as it enhances your encounter powers and increases your ability to withstand injury. Intelligence is your third priority, as it benefits powers from the other deathwarden build and rounds out your defenses. Choose the Channeling Intervention class feature and melee powers that give aid to nearby allies.
You also gain the Channeling Intervention Power.

You lead by using your shield as an interplanar gateway, loosing the baleful fires of the Inferno on your enemies or bathing your comrades in the healing flux of the Astral Sea. You command waves of energy that can target many foes, allowing you to function as a controller as well as a leader. Wisdom is crucial for your attacks, so that should be your highest ability score. Your next priority should be Intelligence, which adds benefits to your build's encounter powers and bolsters your weakest defense. Constitution should be your third highest score to benefit powers from the channeling build. Choose the Portal Intervention class feature and close-range powers that blast your enemies and help your allies stay in the fight.
You also gain the Portal Intervention Power.

Your attacks focus on gaining control over the battlefield rather than doing massive damage to a single target. The power of Death raises fallen foes as undead under your control, waves of necrotic energy weaken your foes, and summoned undead keep your enemies busy. Intelligence governs all of your attack powers, so make it your highest ability score. Charisma affects the secondary aspects of your powers, so make it your second highest ability score. Your third highest score should be Constitution if you wish to dabble in powers from the reaper build. Select powers that work best at a distance and that summon or raise the living dead. Consider a death mask as your implement because it enhances your ability with fear and undead harrowings and synergizes with your high Charisma.

Your favorite powers deal damage to multiple enemies, especially those near to you. Intelligence governs all of your attack powers, so make it your highest ability score. Your second highest score should be Constitution because it affects the secondary effects of many of your powers, grants you more hit points and healing surges, and enhances your Scythe Implement Mastery class feature. Your third highest score should be Charisma if you wish to dabble in powers from the animator build. When using your powers, favor the closer range choices whenever possible because you gain special bonuses when you are near your foes. Consider choosing the scythe as your implement because it enables you to be more offensive with your powers.

The enervator is a necromancer who learns to harness and steal the soul energy of his foes, and develops an almost vampiric taste for the life essence of other beings. Over time the enervator becomes almost addicted to the theft of life forces and in turn becomes a conduit for the deadliest of necrotic energies, the blackfire.

The summoner learns to harness the necrotic energy necessary to speak with and create the undead. He develops a natural affinity, even a sort of immunity to the fear and death effects of such beings over time, and seeks to master these creatures to serve as his vile minions. Summoners favor powers and feats which will best enhance or increase the value of their undead servants.

You are the guardian of the fallen and departed, standing firm at the end of the living world to ensure that those who ought to cross do so and that none call back those who are better left to their deserved rest. You stand firm against those who oppose you, drawing their attacks, and then their bodies, within range of your waiting shield and blade. Your highest score should be Charisma, since all of your attack powers depend on it. Make Wisdom your second-highest score, to improve the secondary effects of your attacks and warding abilities of some of your utility powers. Constitution should be your third-highest ability score, as it will increase your Fortitude defense and your ability to absorb damage. Choose powers that emphasize the defense of your companions and those that disperse your enemies. To get the best effect from your abilities, you should wield a one-handed weapon, such as a longsword or a flail, and a heavy shield.

You are the violent blade of the restless dead, searching out the heart of their defilers and seeking to grant the fallen a peaceful afterlife. You wade in among your enemies, striking powerful blows and sacrificing some of your own measure of life to preserve the lives of those with whom you stand. Charisma should be your highest ability score, since it powers your attacks. Your second highest score should be Constitution, to improve some of the secondary effects of your powers and to increase your hit points and healing surges. Choose Wisdom as your third highest score, since you will want to choose a few powers that help ward you and your allies from attacks. When choosing powers, focus on those that deal high amounts of damage, and those that sacrifice hit points or healing surges to grant more potent effects. To best make use of your powers and abilities, choose a two-handed weapon, preferably one with the reach property, such as the halberd or scythe.

You are an expert in the myths that govern this world and the next. As you hurl your shield at your opponents, you are wrapping it in the power of Manannan, the strength of the Valkyrie, the glare of Charon, the speed of Hermes, the force of Charun, or the might of Odin. Each throw of the shield bears a different influence, a different intent, connected to one of these ancient powers.

Your growth as a deathwarden has taught you to rely on the perceptions of your soul as well as those of your body. At the moment of death, all mortals have the experience of their souls leaving their bodies and perceiving the world around them one last time. You have learned how to harness this perception without dying, although using this ability does require you to draw closer to the veil of death. Your allies trust you as an uncanny scout and a guardian who protects them from threats no one else can see.

You never take life indiscriminately, always having a purpose laid out by your organization. Your purpose might be to kill a rival assassin, to destroy a bully praying on the weak, or to assassinate a political leader of a nearby kingdom. No matter the reason, you take great relish in the destruction of the life, and it fuels your passion for death.

You become an expert in the deadly combination of the element of fire and the poisoner's art. The path of the pyrotechnic killer leads you to spend half your time in the laboratory, where you devise new inflammatory venoms, and the rest on the prowl for opportunities to demonstrate their lethal efficiency. Your allies respect your deadly talents, and have learned how to duck after striking a foe whose innards you have set on fire.

Some people in the world have outlived their usefulness. As a necromancer, you have more use for their lifeless bodies than you do for their pithy comments and worthless lies. For this reason, you have taken it upon yourself to end the lives of those who no longer serve the world in a helpful or useful function. You do not view your work as evil. What these people were doing, wasting the time, love, effort, and goods-of the world: that was evil. By removing these people from the world, you are committing a righteous act.

It is a narrow road you walk, shaping these souls, but you have earned their trust.

Your connection to the spirit world grants you command over spirits even before they pass beyond death's veil. Your advancement along the path of the spiritsworn has shown you how to make your weapon a trap for souls. When you strike an enemy, you can draw out a portion of their spirit, both making them weaker and empowering your weapon. When you choose this path, you become part of an ancestral hierarchy, entitled to seize souls in order to fulfill your responsibilities to those above and below you.

You have always taken your work very seriously. You were an apt pupil, hard working warrior, or devout warden. Now, you have a greater calling. You have learned that some people need to die. The universe has dictated that these individuals are no longer needed; and who are you to deny the universe? You take your role as the angel of death as seriously as anything else in your life before. You receive your notice from death in any number of ways - death's hand is found everywhere. And when you see Death's imprint on a creature, you make it your business to see to that creature's end. It is not out of hatred of that creature or any inherent flaw in that creature's life. It is simply out of necessity to follow the wishes of the greatest force in the universe: Death.

      <specific name="Immortality"> Immortality
You have long been fascinated with death. Although you have flirted with undeath for years, you have finally gained the power necessary to bestow a measure of that untold power upon yourself. Each day that you "live" and "die," a greater portion of unlife seeps into your form, granting you ever greater influence and control over that most powerful and universal of forces.
Each demilich comes to the path in a different way. Yours might simply be a morbid curiosity, a need for power, or a true loathing for life. Regardless of your reasoning and motivation-few would listen if you told them, anyway-there is no question that, in matters of undeath, you are a master without rival. </specific>

Your continued pursuit of power over the threshold of life and death has already given you a measure of immortality; your aging has all but ceased, and while you might suffer the occasional illness or other malady, you recognize that these are but sufferings of the flesh, and will pass when your body does.
The completion of your final quest will mean the culmination of your search for true eternal life in the mortal sphere. Having achieved perfect power over your own life and death, you might lose that power over others, or you might grow into a force so great and terrible as to enforce your will over legions of the dead and nations of the living. Only time, and the choices that you make over those interminable years, will tell.

      <specific name="Level"> 24 </specific>
Once per day, when you die, you can detach your spirit from your body just before death, investing it into a physical vessel known as a phylactery. While contained in the phylactery, all effects and conditions currently affecting you end, you heal to maximum hit points and gain resist 20 to all attacks. You can use at-will and encounter harrowings, but you can't use any daily harrowings, nor can you use any magic item powers or powers with the weapon keyword. You can't walk, run, shift, or crawl, but powers that allow you to fly or teleport, or which push, pull or slide you, work normally. If you are reduced to 0 hit points or lower while in your phylactery, you are dead.
After a short rest, you can rejoin your body if it is within 10 squares. If your body is unavailable or has been destroyed, you can instead choose to inhabit the nearest dead body within 10 squares at the end of your short rest. If you inhabit a body that is not your own, the body changes shape to match your original appearance after your next extended rest. You do not gain any of the qualities or statistics of the new body. If your body is unavailable, and you choose not to inhabit another body, you can reform your own body after an extended rest.
Reentering a physical body takes a hefty toll on the flesh you inhabit. Each time you enter a body after being within your phylactery, it decomposes slightly, creating a horrid and unwelcoming appearance. This has no effect on your statistics, but may be unsettling to onlookers.

This ritual is used to transform a trophy taken from a dead body into a magical token. (See below for details on how to acquire a trophy.) When using a power that deals damage on a hit against a creature, you or an ally possessing a token can expend a token. The token can be used only if that token is of the same origin (aberrant, fey, immortal, natural, or shadow) as the creature. A single token can be used as a free action when the possessor hits with a power that deals damage, dealing additional damage based your check result as described on the chart below. Alternatively, the possessor can gain a bonus on a single Monster Knowledge check concerning a creature of the same origin as your trophy, gaining a bonus based on the chart below. Make a note of the value of the token after you make your Arcana check. These bonuses stacks with those gained from any other sources.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Damage Bonus/Bonus on Knowledge Check
10 or lower	You cannot create a token
11-20	+2 bonuss
21-30	+3 bonus
31-40	+4 bonus
41 or higher	+5 bonus&lt;/table&gt;

Collecting Trophies:
You may collect a trophy as a minor action if you are adjacent to a dead body: a bone, finger, claw, tooth, or similar small part. You must collect the trophy within 1 hour of the creature's death. Make a note of the origin and type of creatures you kill. You might make a note indicating "unicorn: horn of fey magical beast." Players are strongly encouraged to keep accurate records of their kills and trophies. Using this ritual, you can transform the trophy into a token that can be used to power your harrowings.
