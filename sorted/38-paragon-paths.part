  You are intimately familiar with the power that comes with controlling your enemy's emotions. Fear is a good start, but you go even further, pushing fear into madness. You have chosen to draw upon the power of the aberrant creature that brings madness by its mere presence: the gibbering mouther. Your warcry carries the sound of a thousand voices, all shouting different things. Those who hear you claw at their ears, your voice infecting their thoughts and filling their hearts with terror.
  With this power comes a change. Your mind... is different, somehow. Some thoughts come only with difficulty, but at times, you know things that your friends and allies believe you had no way of knowing. You may sometimes try to share your unique viewpoint with others, but even your most innocuous comment brings pain.

  For those who wish to control their foes from a distance, there is no better totem creature than the beholder. Ocular adepts are seekers who wish to control everything they see. They possess minds bursting with energy, looking for release. The first and greatest expression of the link with your totem creature is the manifestation of a spiriteye.
  This weapon resembles nothing more than a ghostly eye which floats in front of the ocular adept. Despite its appearance, a seeker can use some of the principles learned with a mundane ranged weapons to fight with the spiriteye. It takes intense concentration and manipulation of the psionic and primal magics to create the spiriteye, but in time, the ocular adept gains mastery of the weapon and can control it with thought alone.
  Like the eye tyrant, you can make several swift attacks at range and float across the battlefield to a safer location. Attacks made with your spiriteye resemble the beholder's dreaded eye rays, and you have the same variety of effects with them (albeit with less control).

The ancient order of the dark watchers was founded by arcanists who mastered the power of shadow, then matched that power with a righteous understanding of the light of life and the Astral Sea. As a dark watcher, you are a vigilant guardian of the light of life and the natural world. The power taught to you by the order grants you unmatched defensive prowess, allowing you to protect yourself and your allies from the forces of darkness. Only by embracing the shadow can its corruption be turned to light—or so you believe.

From time to time, the Raven Queen's gaze lingers on a mortal soul whose courage and devotion sparks her cold heart. To these mortals she sends a special boon—a raven-shaped shadow whose appearance is a sign of her favor.
	Those who gain this blessing are known as ravenkin, and from that point on they are never truly alone. The shadow raven that keeps them company is a physical connection to the god of death. Devout worshipers of the Raven Queen are the most common ravenkin. However, some ravenkin are recent converts to her faith, unsure of what they have done to warrant such a gift.
	Since the blessing that marked you as a ravenkin, you have been aware that you are watched by the Raven Queen. Some might grow uneasy under such scrutiny, but you embrace it, knowing that you have a special place in the god's plans.

Veiled masters are drawn primarily from the ranks of martial artists who have learned to perceive the world around them with little or no light. In keeping with your veiled master training, you prefer to attack from hiding, either striking from existing shadow or wrapping yourself in the gloom you learn to create. The features of the veiled master path reward those of a stealthy disposition, including monks, rogues, rangers, and other lightly armored warriors.

The life of an adventurer is a life of extremes. Although you stare death (or worse) in the face on a regular basis while serving Avandra, you also embrace everything else life has to offer.
	You find joy in sharing a hearty meal in the company of friends both old and new. You hunt and fish as needed and enjoy the world around you. You delight in journeying to a previously unknown land, whether the journey is safe and quick or filled with peril. When danger draws near or when those around you are in need, you don't hesitate to spring into action, calling upon Avandra as your greatest ally. Regardless of the situation, you embrace life with unbridled confidence and optimism, and you accept the inevitable challenges you face with equanimity.
	All these joys fill your heart to brimming, and you praise Avandra for the opportunity to live an adventurous life filled with beauty and peril.

For centuries, the Oak Shields have guarded the wild areas of the world. Oak Shields, like their namesake trees, are known for longevity, hardiness, and loyalty. Legends claim that Melora personally trained the first members of the order, providing them with the secrets of using everspring groves and standing stones. Ancient sites such as these might hold information on how Melora's faithful can benefit from them.
	Each aspiring Oak Shield studies under a master. Together, the student and the master meditate beneath a sacred oak, seeking enlightenment about the natural world. The student learns to interpret the whispers of the primal spirits and to understand the wisdom of the changing seasons. During this time, he or she comes to appreciate when to stand tall against the wind and when to bend when the wind is too strong. In addition, the student learns about the complexity of the world, how something as simple as a tree can have multiple aspects to its nature. An Oak Shield applies these lessons to his or her life's work as a guardian of the natural order, remaining steadfast in the face of adversity and providing shelter during the storm.

You might choose to take on powers from a second class in place of a paragon path. If you have the Novice Power, Acolyte Power, and Adept Power feats for a class, you can choose to continue to gain powers from that class rather than take a paragon path. If you choose this option, you gain several benefits.
    At 11th level, you can choose to replace one of your at-will powers with an at-will power from your second class.
    In place of the paragon path encounter power gained at 11th level, you can select any encounter power of 7th level or lower from your second class.
    In place of the paragon path utility power gained at 12th level, you can select any utility power of 10th level or lower from your second class.
    In place of the paragon path daily power gained at 20th level, you can select any daily power of 19th level or lower from your second class.
    Psionic Augmentation: If either of your classes has the Psionic Augmentation class feature and you choose paragon multiclassing, the benefits you gain at 11th level are different from those noted above.

Anyone can kill under the right circumstances. Every city boasts hundreds of people willing and able to do the deed, given the motivation. What differentiates you from other would-be killers is your consummate professionalism. You aren't deluded by a purported darkness deep in your heart or some religious obsession. You know your job and you do it well, without fuss, without mess. As a result, your employers return time and time again.
	All kinds of rogues and assassins become contract killers. They take to this path because it provides a steady revenue stream while indulging their talents and inclinations. Scoundrels from other classes adopt this profession once they determine that their consciences raise no objection.

You have nothing to fear from things you control. It's the things you can't control that can ruin you. As a demonologist, you know this lesson well. When you look into the eye of the Abyss, you have no doubt in your mind that you can learn to master it—one demon at a time, if need be.
	You have never shrunk from looking into shady places to serve your ambition. The longer you peer into darkness, the more certain you become that the secret to overwhelming power is hidden in the Abyss. 	
	As a consequence of your studies, you have gained the attention of a minor demon—a filthy quasit. Discussions with this companion have expanded your mind to grim new possibilities. At the same time, the lessons have dissipated any reservations that perhaps you have gone too far. The more you learn from this quasit, the greater the power you control. Thus far, you have blithely ignored a nagging suspicion that somehow things might go terribly wrong.

You gain a quasit companion. The quasit is a creature allied with you, but not with your allies.
	You can communicate telepathically with the quasit as long as it is within 20 squares of you. You do not need line of sight or line of effect to do so.
	Your quasit's level is equal to yours, and its hit points, defenses, and attacks are determined by your level, as noted in its stat block.
	The quasit shares your healing surges. Whenever an effect requires your quasit to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from your total. When you use your second wind, your quasit also regains hit points equal to your healing surge value. At the end of a short rest, your quasit regains all its hit points.
	If you die or your quasit drops below 1 hit point, it disappears. You have two ways of calling your quasit back.
	♦ Minor Action: You take a minor action and lose a healing surge. Doing so causes your quasit to appear in your space with hit points equal to your healing surge value.
	♦ Short or Extended Rest: You lose a healing surge at the end of the rest. Doing so causes your quasit to appear in your space with full hit points.

Quasit Actions
As a creature under your control, your quasit relies on you for strict guidance while you are within 20 squares of it. You take actions so that it can act, and its initiative is the same as yours during an encounter. 	
	Standard Actions: To take a standard action, your quasit needs you to take a standard action to command it to do so.
	Move Actions: Whenever you take a move action, your quasit can also take a move action. Alternatively, you can stay put but take a move action to command your quasit to take a move action.
	Minor Actions: To take a minor action, your quasit needs you to take a minor action to command it to do so.
	Free Actions: Your quasit can take free actions without you taking an action to command it.
	Triggered Actions: The quasit can take a triggered action only if you take the same kind of action to command it to do so. For example, if an enemy adjacent to your quasit companion provokes an opportunity attack from it, you must take an opportunity action to command the quasit to make the attack.
	Quasit Independent Actions: Your quasit serves you against its will. If you are in a situation where you can't give the quasit commands, such as when you are unconscious, stunned, dominated, or more than 20 squares away from it, it acts under the Dungeon Master's control as your enemy. When you can issue commands again, the quasit comes under your control once more.
	A quasit acting independently can take a standard, a move, and a minor action on its turn. It can also take opportunity actions and free actions, but cannot take immediate actions.

Having embraced the dark side of divine magic, you are now ready to delve deeper into the forbidden, to fully embrace the power offered by the dark forces of the cosmos. Only those who have committed evil are invited to study these black arts. Through the filthy deeds you have done and the wickedness in your heart, you have proven yourself worthy.
	Dabbling in occult mysteries carries a heavy price in body, mind, and soul. To harness the magic these entities offer, you must carve your f lesh with blasphemies. To understand the rites, you must push your mind to madness's brink. To prepare your soul, you must indulge in every evil, wallowing in the horror of it all.
	Where paladins fight for honor, good, and order, idols of darkness are treacherous, wicked, and capricious in their dealings. They kill for pleasure. They maim to learn from their victim's suffering. They never hesitate to feed their ambition and to grow their temporal power—they know that beyond the mortal coil lies only annihilation.

Eachthighern (pronounced "Whitehorn"), the Lord of Unicorns, is one of the most respected archfey in the Court of Stars. His wisdom is valued and respected by Queen Tiandra, and rival archfey such as Baba Yaga begrudgingly acknowledge his strength. Unlike most other archfey, Eachthighern takes mortal heroes as his personal knights and sends them forth to stamp out evil creatures wherever they are found.
	When Eachthighern needs a new knight, he sends a herald to one of his choices. These heralds are usually eladrin bards, but sometimes he assigns this duty to more exotic fey such as centaurs or unicorns. The herald transports the prospective knight to the Serene Glade, where Eachthighern makes his offer. If the person refuses the offer, Eachthighern is saddened but respects the candidate's wishes. The herald then takes the person back, but this former candidate loses the memories of the audience thanks to the use of a special type of oblivion moss. If the candidate accepts the offer, the Lord of Unicorns touches the person with his horn, in a manner similar to a king knighting a squire. If the newly accepted knight desires it, he or she receives Eachthighern's heraldic symbol of a unicorn rampant in a field of deep blue, but such displays aren't mandatory because Feywild natives instinctively recognize Lord Eachthighern's mark upon the knight.
	A White Horn knight's quests include anything from rescuing slaves from fomorian holds to guiding travelers safely through dangerous woodlands plagued by mad dryads, sly verbeeg, or ferocious owlbears. The knights count evil fey such as lamias and hags as their greatest opponents, because these creatures often hunt unicorns for their hearts and horns, which such dark fey use in their horrid rituals.
	A White Horn knight is blessed with some of the Lord of Unicorns' power and gains the service of a loyal unicorn steed. The knight's abilities mark the character as a valiant leader in the fight against evil. Though most White Horn knights pay ultimate homage to their lord, some also serve Corellon.

Among the archfey, few entities are more mysterious than the Maiden of the Moon. Elusive even to others of her kind, the Maiden of the Moon has only one apparent interest: removing the blight of lycanthropy, both from the Feywild and from the natural world. On the boundaries of the lycanthrope realm of Brokenstone Vale, some who have survived being ravaged by those creatures find inspiration from the Maiden of the Moon, taking up arms to hunt and slay the lycanthropes. In honor of the Maiden, they call themselves the moon hunters.
	Moon hunters are attuned to the power of the Feywild's moon, which is larger and brighter than the full moon in the natural world. They can channel its power to harm lycanthropes and other shapeshifting foes. In this manner, they are similar to the fey giants known as firbolgs. Like those hunters, they travel across the Feywild, calling forth auras of moonfire to reveal their enemies in the darkness. Once they find their prey, many use crescent-shaped blades to cut their foes down in a bloody harvest.
	In time, most moon hunters expand their hunt to include all creatures that take on another form to prey upon innocent folk, including rakshasas, doppelgangers, hags, oni, and lamias.

All realms see their share of swashbuckling types, whose love for freedom and a happy-go-lucky attitude belie their combat prowess. But the Feywild has given rise to a particularly exotic type of swashbuckler, whose fighting style defies gravity. These daring adventurers are known as soaring rakes.
	Soaring rakes gain their uncanny abilities through a variety of paths, though each has a profound link to the Feywild, either from being born in that realm or through a direct connection to one of the Feywild powers (such as being a fey pact warlock or having the Fey Bond feat). This connection to the Feywild and its ambient magic allows soaring rakes to take to the skies at will. Due to the added element of flight, soaring rakes develop a unique fighting style, and many consider them the ultimate skirmishers.
	Most soaring rakes have an outlook on life that mimics their abilities. Problems, dangers, and frustrations affect them less than most, since the rakes can take to the air and leave their worries behind them. In keeping with their carefree attitude, the vast majority of soaring rakes turn to Avandra for worship, trusting in the god of luck to see them through any challenge.

From brooding fortresses in the Elemental Chaos, the Doomguard watches the decay of the cosmos and its unstoppable slide into dissolution. These stoic warriors believe the universe's fate was sealed when the gods defeated the primordials, because imprisoning these entities kept them from sustaining the world and thus doomed it. The Doomlords are the Doomguard's champions, warriors aligned against those who espouse order and perpetuate corrupt and tyrannical regimes. As is true of their cousins, the Doomguard Marauders (Manual of the Planes), the ranks of the Doomlords include both valiant champions of freedom and murderous anarchists.

The most devoted students of the elements often withdraw from the society of fellow mortals to contemplate the deep truths of existence. You have chosen the lonely path of the elemental anchorite, dedicating yourself to a life of austerity and reflection. When your companions return to home, family, and high honors after their adventures, you instead seek solitude in places of great elemental power. The secrets of the universe are engraved in the stone of mighty mountains and whispered by the winds that sigh across lonely deserts.
	Some elemental anchorites seek isolation in order to master ever more formidable abilities, using elemental essence to further whatever purposes they deem important. Others are more philosophical, and view themselves as servants of balance who act to check the excesses of forces, monsters, or villains that disturb the natural equilibrium of the world. The purpose to which you put your understanding of elemental forces is ultimately up to you.

Your rapport with the elemental powers has grown to such a degree that they regard you as one of their own. Throughout the heroic tier, you established yourself as an able partner, ally, and, perhaps, servant of the elemental powers and in doing so earned greater and greater elemental rewards, including advanced arcane knowledge and more powerful spells. So armed, you stand ready to face even greater threats and reap even greater rewards.
	The elemental powers' favor grants you deeper insights into elemental magic. Not only can your gen servant fetch potent spells, but you can pierce the barriers between the planes to draw forth power to serve your needs. Such command over creation's fundamental forces translates into an improved gen servant that, at your command, can manifest the Elemental Chaos's unruly energies in effective and dangerous ways. Not only does your gen servant improve, but when you master all the elemental gifts, you can transform your servant into a powerful elemental monolith.

Many primordials lie unconscious in their bonds, but Vezzuvu, the Queen of the Burning Mountain, still harbors both awareness and reason. Vezzuvu long ago determined that her road to freedom was to win the devotion (or fear) of mortal followers, and thereby become an elemental god. She can no longer stride the world or reign over an elemental domain, but she can still shake the mortal world by exerting her will on places of elemental power or bestowing on others the ability to call upon her essence.
	As a herald of Vezzuvu, you have been gifted with a portion of the primordial's awesome abilities. You can wield this talent as you like, since Vezzuvu wants others who see your prowess to be drawn to her worship. The Queen of the Burning Mountain requires little from you most of the time, but her interests are erratic; you might walk the world for years without any messages from her, only to be sent suddenly to quell a volcanic rift, destroy the temple of an evil god, or seek out an artifact held by a frost titan.

The Speakers maintain libraries, small colleges, and chapter houses in many elemental domains, including the City of Brass and Zerthadlun, and the organization has small chapters in various mortal worlds as well.
	The Speakers have no great purpose beyond a shared interest in the magic, secrets, and phenomena of the Elemental Chaos. Members report interesting discoveries to their fellows, consult with each other on difficult problems, and work together to collect and preserve unusual knowledge or resources pertaining to the Plane Below. Individual members are also free to follow their own desires regarding whether to share information or respond to calls for assistance from their fellows. The only rule is to treat your colleagues as you would have them treat you.

  The elite hunters of the Moonrise Vanguard live for the chase. Once a seeker engages its prey, she does not return until one of them is captured or dead. Defeating the enemy, however, is not the only goal. The seekers savor the pursuit, hounding their quarry with cunning and style.
  Drawing their power from the primal magic of the veil, the Moonrise seekers dispatch their opponents into the Feywild with the aid of the lunar spirits. In service to the Maiden of the Moon, these seekers try to keep their enemies off balance, using powers such as lunar transposition and echoing shot to rearrange the battlefield as they see fit.

In carrying out the orders of Zehir's high priests without fail, you have conveyed many souls to the dark god's maw and earned great honor. Now, by replacing a portion of your soul with the darkness he commands, Zehir marks you as a worthy servant and transforms you into one of his blessed fangs. You have fought fiercely for this accolade, and members of the Third Coil accord you the respect you have earned as one of Zehir's most zealous servants.
	As a fang of Zehir, your overriding concern is feeding as many souls as possible to your god. You are a holy slayer, dispatched on special missions by Zehir and his high priests. As a reward for your faith, Zehir will alter your mind and body to reflect his glory. It is said that the most faithful of the fangs of Zehir eventually shed their warm-blooded forms altogether, becoming living reflections of their divine master.

    <specific name="Effect"> You summon three bound souls into unoccupied spaces within range. These souls are allies to you and your alies. You grant combat advantage while more than one of your bound souls is present.
	Each soul lacks actions of its own. Instead, you spend actions to command it mentally. When you spend an action to command one of your bound souls, each of your bound souls can also take that same type of action, choosing from the actions in the bound soul's description.
	You must have line of effect to the soul to command it. When you command the soul, you and the soul share knowledge but not senses.
	When a soul makes an attack roll or a check, you make the roll using your statistics, not including any temporary bonuses or penalties.
	each soul lasts until it drops below 1 hit point. At that time, you lose a healing surge (or hit points equal to your surge value if you have no surges lfet). Otherwise, the soul lasts until you dismiss it as a minor action or until the end of the encounter.</specific>
