Regrow Limb removes one Permanent Effect♦. You do not need all the body parts for this to work, only a living subject. You can therefore regrow a severed limb, restore a missing ﬁnger, or even regrow a missing eye.

This Ritual is very taxing on the recipient and can result in Death or Damage, depending on your Skill Check. Subtract all Penalties the target suffers (this means it’s often better to Heal all the Damage and Traumatic Damage♦, and therefore the larger Penalties, before continuing). If the Penalty is smaller than –10, use –10 instead. Compare the result to the chart below.  If the target survives the repairs, he can Heal any Damage caused by the Ritual in the normal fashion. 

This Ritual only works on one Permanent Effect♦ at a time. You may choose to repair any Permanent Effect♦ about which you know. You learn how bad the Penalty is when you cast the Ritual, but may choose to abort casting at that point, saving any Ritual Components.

&lt;table&gt;Heal Check Result	Effect On Target
0 or lower	Target dies.
01-09	Target takes Damage equal to his maximum HP.
10-19	Target takes Damage equal to half his maximum HP.
20-29	Target takes Damage equal to one quarter his maximum HP.
30 or higher	Target takes no Damage.&lt;/table&gt;

Restore Limb removes one Permanent Effect♦. For the Ritual to work, all of the major body parts must be present. You can therefore reattach a severed limb, restore a maimed extremity, or even repair spinal cord damage, but you cannot regrow missing tissue.
This Ritual is very taxing on the recipient and can result in Death or Damage, depending on your Skill Check. Subtract all Penalties the target suffers (this means it’s often better to Heal the Damage and Traumatic Damage♦, and therefore the larger Penalties, before continuing). If the Penalty is smaller than –5, use –5 instead. Compare the result to the chart below. If the target survives the repairs, he can Heal any Damage caused by the Ritual in the normal fashion.
