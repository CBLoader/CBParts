Nothing is more precious to you than your familiar. The connection between you is deeper than that of a master and servant. Your accomplishments are the familiar's, too, and your thoughts are so often in synch that you practically share the same mind. Your familiar grows in power because of the strength of your bond, and arcane energy infuses its being more and more. As your reputation builds, your familiar is a part of your legend. When you begin to hear bard's tales about you, your familiar is mentioned (and sometimes receives top billing), and artistic representations of you show your companion, too.
Your path features all relate to your familiar, and your powers work only if your familiar is in active mode. Since it's important that your familiar stick around if you want to make full use of it, take some familiar feats (from Arcane Power) to increase its defenses and to gain other benefits.
