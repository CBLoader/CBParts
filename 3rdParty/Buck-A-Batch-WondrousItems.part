Dropping this fist size stone onto an adjacent square creates a zone that affects the accuracy of ranged weapons. Any creature that makes a ranged attack with a non-magical weapon suffers a -1 penalty to their attack for each affected square that the thrown or fired weapon passes through. An attack that misses due to the penalty it accumulates in the zone lands in the stone's space. </specific>
