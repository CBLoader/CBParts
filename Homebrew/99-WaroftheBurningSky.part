      <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Some magnificent failure on your part resulted in the utter loss of your honor. Many dragonborn in your position would seek death, but you have not. Why? Were you wrongly accused? If not, what did you do that cost you your honor? Would you do it again? How might you regain your honor? A few small clans of dragonborn inhabit the mountains between the Ostalin and Ragesian border. Loosely in communication with each other, the predominant goal is to solidify the creation of a new republic of dragonborn within the mountains. Those who adventure often do so to lay foundations for future diplomacy, learn and improve on the latest technologies of war and combat, or seek riches and glory to advance the dragonborn legacy and become the future leaders of the new empire. </specific>

Convinced that the isolationism is just as imprisoning as their ancient servitude to the giants, the adventurous dwarves venture out to build an inspiring legacy, rekindle the pride of the Dwarven nation, or restore faith in the ancient gods that seem to be forgotten in this modern day. </specific>

To the gnomes, knowing how one could capture and enslave another allows the knowledgeable to avoid the possibility altogether. Their quick wit and seeming mockery of the Ragesians and the Shahalesti is vexing to orcs and eladrin alike. Most gnomes come from Shahalesti, but some small groups can be found in almost any land.

In recent decades, the gregarious nature of Gate Pass merchants traveling the Lands has impressed some tieflings, and a few have set up a small merchant house within the fifth district of the capital, the mountain city of Kistan. The small but cosmopolitan city offers charms and temptations that make it enticing to those who struggle between good and evil and, though small, the merchant house is growing, both in legitimate trade and in their less noble underworld dealings. </specific>

You gain the vow of healing power.
  You cannot refuse to heal an injured living creature who asks you for healing. This obligates you to use your vow of healing power once on any such creature, though you are not required to heal enemies until they surrender and you are reasonably sure they cannot betray you. You cannot perform a coup de grace on a living creature, nor can you target damage against a dying living foe (you may deal damage to them with area attacks, though you must make a best effort to avoid doing so). If you violate this oath, you lose the benefit of this feat for 24 hours. Repeated or flagrant transgressions can result in permanent loss of this benefit until you receive atonement.

The token disintegrates and releases its power, which forms a huge flapping fan, causing a breeze of sufficient strength to propel one ship (about 25 mph). This wind is not cumulative with existing wind speed. The token can, however, be used to lessen existing winds, creating an area of relative calm or lighter winds (wave size in a storm is not affected). The fan can be used for up to 8 hours. It does not function on land. </specific>

A Medium-sized, invisible force performs small tasks at your command. It can fetch objects, open unstuck doors, move furniture (up to 100 pounds), make camp and perform basic functions like mending and cleaning. It may perform the same task repeatedly, but can only perform one task at a time. It is limited to tasks that require a skill check of DC 10 or less.The arcane servant has a speed equal to the caster’s native speed. It occupies no space and cannot attack or be attacked. It cannot move more than 20 spaces from the focus.
Focus: A small mannequin held in hand or otherwise in possession of a creature. The arcane servant will disappear on a failed saving throw if the focus is abandoned or dropped.

The ritual’s area (6 squares) is traced with a faintly glowing line of energy. The ritual creates a subtle defensive barrier against magical attacks, causing all damage from spells and summoned creatures in the area of effect to become nonlethal. Whenever a creature enters the warded area, it must consciously choose to accept this restriction, or else the spell ends. If at any time a creature inside the area wishes to no longer abide by the duelist’s etiquette, he can spend a standard action to concentrate and end the ritual. All creatures in the area of effect are immediately aware the ritual has ended.
This ritual is primarily used to ensure that spell duels are not fatal, without forcing mages to hold back their strongest powers.

No scrying sensor can enter the area of Hallowed Ground and no creature can teleport into it, unless the sensor or the creature is higher level than the ritual caster who performed the ritual.
	Your Religion check determines the size of the warded area, which is a burst.

9 or lower	Burst 1
10–19	Burst 3
20–29	Burst 5
30–39	Burst 8
40 or higher	Burst 12&lt;/table&gt;

Also, the following effects are placed on the burst:
1. Good-aligned creatures gain a +2 bonus to all defenses.
2. Evil creatures cannot teleport in the burst area
3. Charm attacks by evil creatures automatically fail.
4. Divine casters gain a +4 Wisdom bonus to their Channel Divinity: Turn Undead roll.
5. Creatures inside the burst cannot be turned into undead.

The warding effect lasts for 24 hours, but the ritual caster (not any assistants) can extend this duration by expending a healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. The caster does not need to be in the same area or even on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the effect becomes permanent.

When you perform this ritual, you can select up to eight recipients to receive the spell’s benefits. The creature and all the equipment it carries suffers no harm from being in even extreme heat. It can exist comfortably in temperatures as high as 500 degrees Fahrenheit. This protection is sufficient to endure the oven-like heat of a forest fire, but fire damage is treated normally.
A ritually affected creature that has ongoing fire damage (save ends) may use a move action to automatically save at the end of its turn.
