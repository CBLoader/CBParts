Your faith in Kord gave you the strength to survive, and Kord rewarded your actions by the thunder in the stands and the sight of another blood-red dawn each day. 
     How did you become a gladiator? Was it a choice, were you a criminal, did you owe debts, or were you a slave? How did you escape the games? Did you win your freedom, break free, or decide to walk away from the glory you could have gained through meaningless slaughter? Did you see any unusual creatures in the arena?

Worship of Kord seemed as natural as a sailor praying to Melora.
     How did you first learn you are a berserker? Do you see it as a blessing or a curse? What are your people like? Does your family have a berserker tradition, or are you an anomaly? Is your faith in Kord in gratitude for this gift, or do you hope to endure and overcome it?</specific>

Your size made you the target of ridicule when you were young, and it was years before you fully understood what a boon it was. When you learned about Kord, something clicked. You had all the power needed—all you required was the will to use it. Controlling your strength, knowing when to use it and when words are enough, is something you had to learn in back alleys. Once you started standing up for yourself, it felt like an endless stream of bullies and toughs wanted to test your mettle.
     Do you still feel like you have something to prove? Do your adventures represent you taking on the other bullies in the world, or are they your attempts to face down internal demons from your past? Is being brave still something with which you struggle? Do you have any fears from a past you never conquered?</specific>

When the lightning slashes the sky and the waves toss the ship like a leaf on the wind, you like nothing better than to be at the prow, leaning out into the tempest like a living figurehead. Other sailors think you're crazed. On a ship your bravery cannot be doubted, but when the storms come, your sanity has been questioned. You've been lashed to the mast, and some have accused you of attracting Kord's wrath. You know the truth, though. On the sea you hear Kord the clearest, and in his storms you laugh along with him.
     Were you captain of a ship or just a crew member? On what kinds of vessels did you sail: merchant, military, or any boat that left port? Why don't you sail as often as you once did? Is there some danger in the sea you aren't facing? Do you seek something on land such as a treasure or special magic item?</specific>

Then one day a thunderbolt struck you out of the blue sky. You awoke in the arms of friends who were awed that you survived. From that brilliant instant when your world turned to fire and pain, you have had your shock of white hair and your cloudy "storm eye." They serve as daily reminders of your survival despite a lightning bolt that seemingly singled you out. That you escaped death, perhaps death hurled by Kord, gave you courage. At first you lacked the strength to back up your bravery, but you persisted and endured the beatings, learning and becoming stronger until at last none would call you weakling or coward. You know now that if the lightning strike came from Kord, it was not his anger, but his blessing: a test that you passed with flying colors.
     Did you make any friends among those who once bullied you? Do any of the friends you had before the lightning strike resent the new you? Do you think the lightning strike was from Kord, or do you suspect a more mortal source? Does your storm eye have any special powers? </specific>

Thunder heralded your arrival in the world, and when you took your first breath, the tempest and battle fell eerily silent as the eye of the storm—Kord's eye—passed over you. Since then you were tutored and trained by warrior-scholars of Kord. For years, every moment of your waking hours was dedicated to preparing you for something: exercises, combat training, tactics and strategy, lessons about all the great conquerors, and the fighting techniques of a dozen nations. Then one day your teachers said you were ready; they had no more to teach you and you must seek to learn more in the wider world.
     Do you know for what your teachers were preparing you? Did they? Did your parents agree to give you over to the priests of Kord, or were you taken? What was the battle about when you were born? Do you believe yourself to be as important to Kord as those who taught you? </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> You study Nerathi lore, learning from the past to better the future. Perhaps you're inspired by great works of Nerathi literature or art, finding universal truths in their ancient expression. Maybe you marvel at the ruins of ancient Nerathi baths, forums, or roads, feeling that your homeland deserves the comforts enjoyed by your ancestors. Or maybe you're a student of the great philosopher Tallas, whose ethics guided the society which once ruled the world. Regardless of what you study, you're driven to bring this knowledge back to civilization. Be cautious though: the world's kings and nobles won't willingly surrender their authority. Thankfully, you are not alone in this search. Many cities shelter likeminded individuals who long to see their homes rise to the heights set by Nerath. Whether they are hidden societies or mobs in search of a leader, working with these groups may help you change the world.
    Personal Quests: Explore Nerathi ruins for ancient lore; assist a troubled realm with your accumulated knowledge; govern justly using the ethics of Nerath. </specific>

Of all the scions of Nerath, you and your kind are the most pure to the imperial legacy. You were steeped in the empire's rich culture and philosophy through a line of unbroken teachers and grandsires. From birth you've been groomed for a purpose. Perhaps that is to preserve Nerath's only living culture from agents of the Ruler of Ruin, or maybe it's to wage war against him in a final battle to restore Nerath. You may have even made a warlock pact with your fey host.

What were the circumstances of your recruitment into the legions, and why are you now separated from them? Has your general issued you special orders requiring you to venture away from a battlefield?

Lady Tamora is fair but stern, sanctioning retaliation against fey incursions and doing her best to protect her people. Orlando is brave and honest, but he has shown no interest in rulership since his father died a decade ago. He has refused involvement in any action against the Sildane fey.
   Do you know the Tamora family well? What was your job in Crystalbrook before you answered Count Varis&apos;s call? What was your reputation beyond your known competence?

    <specific name="Common Kowledge">You were raised among merchants who traveled the trails of the Feywild, carting all kinds of mundane and exotic goods. Your clan was made up of gnomes, half-elves, fey-touched humans, another fey race, or a group of mixed races. Eladrin rarely become merchants, but some former nobles might be forced to take up the trade business, catering to the current nobility's needs. During your youth, you probably stayed in one of the merchant quarters in a small village or in the eladrin capital of Astrazalian, the mercantile hub of the Feywild. You were raised and educated in the expectation that you would follow the family tradition and help run the bsiness. However, fate had other plans.</specific>

  <specific name="type"> Campaign </specific>
  <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Several elven realms have stood in the forest of Cormanthor for thousands of years. The current incarnation of Myth Drannor is merely the latest. It is built atop the ruins of the famous realm of Cormanthyr, whose capital was Myth Drannor, City of Song.
	In 1374 DR, the sun elf lord Seiveril Miritar destroyed the invading daemonfey (demonic elves) and recaptured the ruins of Myth Drannor, at the cost of his life. His daughter, Ilsevele Miritar, took up leadership over the elven army. With her assistance, the high mage Araevin Teshurr sealed the portals of the city and repaired the mythal that had long lay damaged. Ilsevele Miritar assumed the long-lost title of coronal and reestablished Myth Drannor as an elven kingdom.
	Myth Drannor claims sovereignty over the ancient woodland of Cormanthor, from the shores of Lake Sember to the River Lis. However, its people are few in number, and wide stretches of the land under the coronal&apos;s authority are empty wilderness. Many parts of the forest are still quite dangerous: monster-filled elven ruins dating back centuries, haunted manors and strongholds raised by long-forgotten human lords, and hidden caverns leading deep into the Underdark. The old kingdom of Myth Drannor was a bastion of goodness and might that kept the entire region safe, but the new Myth Drannor must rely on diplomacy, arcane lore, stealth, and vigilant scouts to protect its own borders.
	The folk of Myth Drannor have forged strong ties with Cormyr. Myth Drannor has also resurrected the ancient compact with the Dalelands. The elven realm is a force to be reckoned with once more. </specific>
  <specific name="Benefit"> Once per encounter, you can reroll a failed saving throw against a charm effect. </specific>
  <specific name="Short Description"> This ancient elven kingdom was once the foremost power north of the Sea of Fallen Stars before it fell into darkness seven centuries ago. It remained a monster-haunted ruin for hundreds of years until the sun and moon elves reclaimed the kingdom shortly before the Year of Blue Fire. Myth Drannor has flourished since its refounding. </specific>
