Without an implement, a wizard can still use his or her powers. A wizard wielding a magic orb, staff, or wand can add its enhancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls of wizard powers, as well as wizard paragon path powers, that have the implement keyword. </specific>

Wizards are scions of arcane magic. Wizards tap the true power that permeates the cosmos, research esoteric rituals that can alter time and space, and hurl balls of fire that incinerate massed foes. Wizards wield spells the way warriors brandish swords.
	Magic lured you into its grasp, and now you seek to master it in turn. You could be a bespectacled sage searching for dusty tomes in forgotten sepulchers, a scarred war mage plying foes with fireballs and foul language in equal measure, a disgruntled apprentice who absconded with your master's spellbooks, an eladrin upholding the magical tradition of your race, or even a power-hungry student of magic who might do anything to learn a new spell.
	A cloak of spells enfolds you, ancient rituals bolster your senses, and runed implements of your craft hang from your belt. Effervescing arcane lore pulses through your consciousness, a constant pressure craving release. When will you know enough magic to storm the ramparts of reality itself?

A mage is a specialized wizard, a spellcaster who focuses on the tenets of a particular school of magic. This specialization makes each mage distinctive. After all, a mage who casts evocation spells presents a very different picture to the world from a mage who has mastered the art of illusion or enchantment.
	Mages tend to approach arcane magic with a more scholarly bent than other wizards, and that's saying a lot. Don't expect to find adventuring mages hidden away in dusty towers, however. They hit the ground running, ready to explore every dungeon and ancient ruin in search of lore and knowledge that will increase their understanding of everything arcane-and thereby increase their personal power.
	The ancient traditions of the schools have been handed down since the first mortals began to dabble in arcane magic. What started as techniques and methods of training between masters and apprentices eventually became more institutionalized, and eventually actual academies of arcane study sprang up in the world and even among the eladrin of the Feywild. In time, single towers devoted to a single arcane discipline gave way to grand academies where illusion magic was taught alongside evocation magic.
	Today, where and how arcane magic is taught depends on where you happen to be. On the borderlands, in places such as Fallcrest, solitary mages pass on their knowledge to one or two apprentices at a time. In larger settlements, such as the city of Nera, academies are dedicated to the training of mages in all of the schools of magic.

At the end of each of your extended rests, you can prepare encounter attack powers, daily attack powers, and utility powers from your spellbook. These are the powers that you can use during that day, in addition to your at-will attack powers, cantrips, and nonwizard powers, such as a racial power. If you do not prepare powers from your spellbook after an extended rest (for example, if you do not have access to your spellbook), you can use the same powers you had prepared on the previous day.
	Find your level on the Spells Prepared per Day table. The row corresponding to your level indicates how many encounter attack powers, daily attack powers, and utility powers you are allowed to prepare each day. You cannot prepare more than one power of any given level on the same day. For example, a 14th-level mage who has taken the enigmatic mage paragon path can prepare four encounter attack powers per day. Her spellbook contains multiple encounter attack powers at various levels. She can prepare four powers from any of the levels, as long as none of the prepared powers are of the same level.

SPELLS PREPARED PER DAY
&lt;table&gt;Level	Encounter	Daily	Utility
   1	1	1	0
   2	1	1	1
  3-4	2	1	1
   5	2	2	1

 10-15	3	3	3
 16-21	3	3	4
 22-30	3	3	5&lt;/table&gt;
•Certain wizard paragon paths, such as the enigmatic mage, allow you to prepare one additional spell per day in certain cases.

While the target is under this effect, you gain a +5 power bonus to Bluff checks against it.
	This effect ends if you or any of your allies attacks the target or any of its allies. Afterward, the target doesn't remember that you used this power on it. </specific>

Enchantment magic used in the thick of combat typically needs to control an enemy only for a moment. Outside battle, a wizard can afford to undertake a more subtle approach. Instant friends creates a rapport between caster and target, making it possible for you and your allies to gain valuable aid and information.

Mortals occasionally stumble through planar gateways and into the fey realm. Eladrin patrols pride themselves on keeping tight control of such intruders with their powerful magic. In the midst of a battle, a bout of blissful ignorance unleashed on a pack of foes can give you and your allies all the time you need to set up the most advantageous attack position—or to escape a fight you can't win.

This powerful enchantment grants you temporary control of an entire group of enemies, forcing them to turn on each other in combat. Mass charm is especially effective against minions and badly wounded creatures, which can be forced to swarm a more powerful enemy. One of your allies can then make use of an area attack to cut down the tightly packed foes.

	If the saving throw succeeds, this power has no effect. The target is aware that you used this power on it if it is the same level as you or a higher level. Otherwise, it does not know you used this power.
	On a failed saving throw, the target treats you as a trusted friend for 6 hours. It truthfully answers all questions you ask, and aids you in any way it can as long as doing so does not risk its life or property. While the target is under this effect, you gain a +5 power bonus to Bluff checks against it.
	If you or any of your allies attacks the target or any of its allies, the effect ends on that target. Afterward, the target doesn't remember that you used this power against it. </specific>

Otto found that certain strains of music consistently inspired a physical response. This spell builds on that principle, creating a wave of dominating magic that inevitably crumbles a victim's resolve. Each time a creature shrugs off your attempt to control it, your song of command becomes more insistent in response.

Corpses are rarely still in the presence of a necromancer. Casting this spell animates bones already in the soil, tasking them to lash out at an enemy. Sometimes the bones are skeletal claws, but more often they are flailing bird skeletons, skittering mouse bones, or the remains of another woodland or field animal. On the rare occasion that an area is devoid of bones, spectral claws rise from the ground to do the necromancer's bidding.

The Shadowfell is often described as the natural world's dark reflection. Its locations resemble those found in the world, but of a twisted and unseemly variety. If locations can be reflections, so too can people. This spell conjures a dark reflection of your foe.

Some wizards believe that all shadows touch the Shadowfell and that they can bridge the distance between the worlds through the use of the proper spell. Umbral leap allows a wizard to slip through shadow, vanishing and reappearing some distance away. Although capable of covering a great distance, the spell requires a darkened destination square, limiting its utility in certain environments.

Acererak is the most famous of those wizards whose long focus on death culminated in immortality as a lich. Few wizards have the courage to complete similar unholy rituals, but necromancers have learned the value that such a transformation provides, even if it lasts only minutes at a time.

Wizards who dabble in shadow magic do so at great risk to their souls; they bargain away part of themselves to acquire dark magic. True masters, however, take this liability and turn it into an advantage. A wizard under the effect of wraithform becomes a creature of pure shadow, little more than billowing darkness held in a vague humanoid shape.

With its crumbling towers teetering on the brink of oblivion, Moil is one of the most terrifying places in the Shadowfell's depths. According to legend, Orcus f lung the accursed city from the world to shadow's edge, trapping its people in ice and death for all time. The Moilian people were said to be masters of shadow magic and had bargained away their souls for its power. Many of their advances have been lost, but a few spells of terrible power have managed to escape the city's frozen grasp.

You can designate one creature you have cast a wizard spell upon that has an effect that lasts until the subject succeeds on a saving throw. That creature takes a penalty to its next saving throw against that effect equal to your Wisdom modifier.
Alternatively, you can choose to extend the duration of an effect created by a wizard at-will spell (such as cloud of daggers or ray of frost) that would otherwise end at the end of your current turn. The effect instead ends at the end of your next turn. </specific>

You learn to turn your own pain into additional pain for your enemies. When you use a wizard encounter attack power, a wizard daily attack power, or a blood mage attack power that deals damage, you can, once per turn as a free action just prior to using the power, deal either a minor wound or a severe wound to yourself.
A minor wound deals 1d10 damage to you.
A severe wound deals 2d10 damage to you.
You then gain a bonus to the damage roll against one of the power&apos;s targets (your choice). The bonus equals the damage you dealt to yourself.

Like all bladesingers, you can channel magic through your chosen blade, treating it as an implement. When you use the weapon as an implement, it works like a normal implement, but you gain neither the weapon's proficiency bonus nor its nonmagical properties, such as high crit or versatile. A weapon's range and damage dice are usually irrelevant to implement powers, since such powers tend to specify their range and damage.
	If your chosen blade is magical and you use it as an implement, you can also use its enhancement bonus, critical hit effect, properties, and powers. However, some magic weapons have properties and powers that function only with weapon powers. </specific>

Those who see a bladesinger in battle never forget the sight. Amid the chaos and blood, the bladesinger moves in an otherworldly dance. Spells and sword act as partners, matching awe-inspiring beauty with an awful deadliness. When the bladesinger engages in the true heart of the art, when the sword whirls through the air so swiftly that it keens and the air hums and whistles in chorus, when the bladesong has begun—then the bladesinger becomes something unreal, something timeless.
	According to legend, Corellon himself inspired and taught the first bladesinger. The techniques handed down as a gift from the leader of the elven deities have passed from one to another among the Tel'Quessir for untold generations, and though different styles evolved as eladrin and elves turned its power to suit their needs, none have improved upon the essential core of the art.
	The bladesinger wields a weapon one-handed, leaving the other free or using it to employ a wand that can be incorporated into the fighting style. This technique gives a bladesinger the speed and freedom of movement necessary for the dancelike motions of the various forms of martial art, which allow for both magical and physical attacks to flow freely.
	Few among the Tel'Quessir have the honor of being inducted into the bladesingers. One must have the mind necessary to be a great wizard, and also the agility of the greatest dancer. Yet those traits alone are not enough. A bladesinger is first and foremost devoted to the ways and the people of the Tel'Quessir, for that was the purpose of Corellon's gift.
	A bladesinger who has set out beyond the borders of a nation of the People must have had good cause. Adventuring bladesingers might seek out relics or locations of great meaning to the Tel'Quessir, or they could leave in order to guard a specific person or group against harm. A bladesinger might instead embark upon a quest to eliminate a threat to the People or to find and communicate with some long-lost branch of the race. In a more tragic case, a bladesinger might have failed in the duty to protect a community and be death-pledged to avenge it and restore his or her honor.

As you attain certain levels, you learn two new wizard powers and add them to your spellbook (two wizard utility powers at 2nd level, for instance). At the end of each of your extended rests, you choose a number of wizard powers from your spellbook and prepare them. The number you can prepare is determined by your level.
	The powers that you prepare are the wizard powers that you can use during the coming day, in addition to your at-will attack powers and powers from another source, such as racial powers. If you do not prepare powers from your spellbook after an extended rest (for example, if you do not have access to your spellbook), you can use the same powers you had prepared on the previous day. See the Wizard Powers Learned table for the levels at which you add wizard powers to your spellbook.
	Any wizard encounter attack power that you add to your spellbook through this class feature functions as a daily attack power for you. In other words, you can use it once per day, rather than once per encounter, and you can use the power again only after an extended rest. Because the power functions as a daily attack power, you cannot regain its use from any effect that recharges encounter attack powers.
	Find your level on the Wizard Powers Prepared per Day table. The row corresponding to your level indicates how many wizard encounter attack powers and wizard utility powers you can prepare each day. (The table does not account for powers that you might have from another source, such as a paragon path.) You cannot prepare more than one attack power and one utility power of any given level on the same day.

Elves and eladrin must take care when using flame in the forest homes of their people, and thus many bladesingers learn to command the fires that their magic produces. The blow of a sword provides the opening to unleash a spritelike fire that burns an enemy without fear of anything else being set to smolder.

Part religion, part ritual, and all mystery, witchcraft is an ancient practice that came about in an age before arcane magic was studied, institutionalized, and etched in writing, when monstrous titans ruled over creation and the secret of making fire was yet undiscovered. In this chaotic dark age, the gods had little influence on the titans' world. Instead of seeking their aid, the primitive peoples called out to the night for protection and power, and a voice from the darkness answered. Those who accepted its arcane gifts became the first witches, and they wielded such power as only immortals had known-seen by some jealous gods as an affront that they have never forgiven.
	Witches gain their power from a patron who instructs them by way of a mystical familiar that comes and goes as it pleases, unbound by the strictures of the material world. The most prevalent patron among witches-the original voice from the darkness-is the moon goddess Sehanine, referred to by witches as simply the Goddess. Other entities have since seen the advantage of imbuing mortals with power, and so your patron might be an archfey, a god, an angel, a primordial, a demon lord, a devil, or another legendary being that believes it can benefit by imbuing you with a gift of arcane prowess. It might prefer to remain anonymous.
	The circumstances by which you obtained your gift can vary widely. Some witches seek out the gift in order to fulfill a personal desire or vendetta, while others were brought up in a coven. Some receive their power after making a pact with a devil, as a warlock might do, and others have it bestowed upon them by a fairy godparent or a witch queen.
	Though witches are common among the fey races in the Feywild, as a witch in the natural world you must be mindful of whom you trust. In the world, common folk fear your kind. Envious wizards refuse to acknowledge you as a peer and would see your wondrous powers vanish from the world, while clerics of jealous gods decree you an unholy menace, sending witch hunters to track you down and destroy you.

		<Flavor> When you create your witch, you choose a moon coven with which you are affiliated. A moon coven is a loose order of witches that share a philosophy of witchcraft. Each moon coven represents one of two phases of the moon-full or dark (new)-and symbolizes the witch's quintessential attitude toward the application of his or her craft. Each moon coven reflects a member witch's philosophy regarding the use of magic-not necessarily corresponding to the witch's alignment, since witches of all alignments are found in each coven. Nevertheless, a greater number of evil witches gravitate toward the dark moon and its powers over ill fortune and necromancy, whereas good witches more frequently affiliate themselves with the full moon coven and favor its charms and healing magic. 
	Witches are solitary by nature, requiring little arcane instruction beyond the teachings of their familiar, and most prefer to keep their craft secret lest they be targeted by witch hunters. Therefore, a moon coven typically convenes only once during the course of a year, in an isolated location in the wilderness often near standing stones, ley lines, or other sites that thrum with arcane power, on an evening when the coven's moon phase displays in its ideal state in the dark heavens above. Despite their opposing philosophies on witchcraft, the two moon covens sometimes come together on the night of a lunar eclipse, when both are symbolically represented in the night sky. Such meetings occur only when all witches, or the world in which they live, are threatened by forces bent on their extermination. 
	In addition to, or instead of, meeting with their moon coven, some witches gather in local covens attended by witches that inhabit the area. Such local covens are often the way new witches are initiated into the craft, and they show the initiate the way to call on a powerful entity and receive the gift of its power in the form of a familiar. These local covens usually have their own aims and goals related to their immediate surroundings, and might or  right not adhere to the philosophy of either of the moon covens. 
	Many witches learn their craft in isolation, unaware of the presence of the fundamental moon covens, or  even of other witches. Regardless of whether a witch or a local coven identifies with a moon coven, every witch makes a choice concerning the type of witchcraft he or she wants to practice. </Flavor>

		<Flavor> Because of their intimate connection with powerful otherworldly entities, witches are well versed in the arcane arts of fortune telling and prophecy. The witch's familiar instructs them in the means to look deep into the spirit world and see the patterns and images that reveal the future. Some learn to read runes, decks of cards, tea leaves, knucklebones, or weather patterns. Some gaze into crystal balls or boiling cauldrons, and some channel spirits directly into their bodies, which foretell the future. As a witch, your method of prophecy might be one of these or it could be a ritual of your own devising. Witches are said to achieve the most favorable results beneath the light of the moon. </Flavor>

		<Category> 1 </Category>
		<Flavor> Unlike other wizards, a witch receives the gift of arcane power from a patron such as an archfey, a god, a devil, an angel, a demon, or another powerful being. The witch might or might not be aware of the patron's true identity or its reasons for bestowing power, but such entities always have their reasons, which become clear in time, for good or ill.
	A witch's familiar takes the shape of a Tiny creature, usually a natural or a fey beast such as a cat, a serpent, or a raven, and acts as an intermediary between the witch and the patron of the witch's power. Bound to the witch's soul, this familiar instructs the witch in the use of supernatural powers. 
	Your familiar can have as active a role as you like. Familiars have a distinct personality and a unique relationship with the witches they instruct. Your familiar might provide hints and lore, or it might be a subtle presence in the background that appears and disappears without a sound, if you prefer to downplay its role in your story. </Flavor>

If you do so, you gain combat advantage against every target of that power the next time you use it during the current encounter.

Your size category also increases by one (from Medium to Large, for instance); however, your weapons do not grow, and when you use a close power, you must choose a single square in your space as its origin square. You can end this form as a minor action. </specific>

Wizards use fragile form to transform their enemies into dolls made of flimsy, easily destroyed materials. A spark or a flame typically consumes such creatures so quickly that there is little left of them by the time the spell has run its course. A wizard typically reserves this spell for an enemy that poses so great a threat it must be eliminated quickly.

As happened with many eladrin secrets, it did not take long for knowledge of this spell to spread to other races.

Sha'irs cull magical energy from the Elemental Chaos to power their spells. Rather than pore over ancient formulas and techniques, these wizards bargain with elemental powers for the magical knowledge they need. Sha'irs do not deal directly with these powers; instead, they rely on proxies, elemental spirits called gen servants, to negotiate on their behalf. Dispatching these servants to the Elemental Chaos each day, a sha'ir replenishes the necessary power and information to wield the forces of creation.
	Their unconventional methods, combined with their reputation for consorting with dangerous, often violent, powers, place sha'irs on the fringes of the magical world. Other wizards regard sha'irs with scorn and distrust, believing that they cheat by circumventing the arduous training and research wizards must typically undergo. This mistrust stems from ignorance, however, for even though a sha'ir draws magic from a gen servant, a foundation in arcane training is necessary to wield the power he or she gains.
	Since sha'irs do not clutter their minds with mystical formulas and arcane utterances, they have wider access to spells than other wizards enjoy. They need only know a spell's basic structure to request it from their gen servants. The gen servant then vanishes into the Elemental Chaos, where it bargains with more powerful elemental lords and creatures to acquire the spell the sha'ir seeks and then returns without fail to provide its master with the energy and means to cast the spell. So even though sha'irs do not employ spellbooks, they have access to the full expanse of wizards' most powerful and versatile spells.
	The elemental powers that lend magical knowledge and energy to sha'irs do not do so without an expectation of recompense. Sha'irs often take up the adventurer's life for this reason. They work in the world and beyond as representatives, agents, and servants of their elemental masters. Many times a sha'ir does not even realize that his or her actions are furthering some elemental being's designs, and what might seem to be a normal expedition into the unknown could have consequences not realized for years to come.

    <Flavor> Elemental magic bows to no mortal master. Only those steeped in elemental energy or who can broker with the elemental powers can coax forth its magic. You enlist the aid of a minor elemental spirit, a gen servant, to keep you supplied with the magical energy you need to cast your spells. Each day, you dispatch this servant to the Elemental Chaos to steal, beg, or borrow this energy from the greater powers residing there. When the servant returns, the energy it brings back floods into your mind.
	A gen servant is an arcane familiar forged from your own essence and that of elemental substance until it adopts a fixed and permanent form. As with any familiar, the characteristics that your gen servant takes on depend on you. The familiar might just be an extension of your magical abilities, or it might develop a distinctive personality, aiding you with knowledge from the Plane Below.

The new power must have a level, and its level must be the same as the old power's level.

The archmage Bigby is best known for the various “hand” spells that bear his name. Legend holds that he recorded scores of these spells in the much-sought volume titled Manual of Powers Beyond Life. The more famous spells have been copied from the original tome and found their way into wizards' spellbooks across the known world. Bigby's icy grasp fashions a flexible hand from ice. While it is present, you can direct it to snatch your enemies and bind them in its grasp.
