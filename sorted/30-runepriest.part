Many runepriests follow one of the two major traditions of rune magic: the path of the Wrathful Hammer or the way of the Defiant Word. The two traditions use the same runes but differ in their practices and teachings.
Although most shan zi in Kara-Tur follow the two major traditions of rune magic, Defiant Word and Wrathful Hammer, a sizable minority practices the tradition of the Serene Blade. When creating a runepriest, you can choose the following Runic Artistry option instead of those in Player's Handbook 3.

Many who follow the Path of Enlightenment spread knowledge of righteousness but also teach about karma, which can be simply if incompletely described as the idea that one reaps what one sows. With a wide arc of your weapon, you scribe words of karma upon your enemies, so they know that whatever violence they use will be visited upon them.

All across Kara-Tur, runepriests go from village to village teaching not only literacy, but also the lessons found in the Path of Enlightenment. Such selfless acts, in turn, bring these runepriests closer to their own enlightenment. Recognizing this truth, a few shan zi learn how to share their blessings with their comrades and allies, further pushing back the darkness so that the light of the Celestial Emperor can purge the world of ignorance and evil. The following paragon path is available to any honorable runepriest who strives to become the consummate leader, acting through his or her allies to vanquish the opposition.

During the Dawn War, each god created a unique icon of divine power to serve his or her purposes. Many of these were shattered or lost during the clash, and after it had ended, the gods sought their restoration. Runepriests are natural seekers of lost artifacts, envoys of the gods sent to recover their ancient relics, and benefit from their patrons' protection.
