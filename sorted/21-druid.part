You gain the following benefits.
	* Your animal companion is a living zephyr.
	* When wielding a spear or a staff, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC and Reflex.

You gain an animal companion associated with the season you chose for your Acolyte of the Natural Cycle class feature.
    Your animal companion is considered an ally of you and your allies. It can be affected by powers in the same way as any other creature can be.
    You can communicate telepathically with your animal companion as long as it is within 20 squares of you. You do not need line of sight or line of effect to do so. Your animal companion has only animal intelligence, so it cannot communicate or understand complex topics.
    Your animal companion's level is equal to yours, and its hit points, defenses, and attacks are determined by your level, as noted in its stat block.
    Your animal companion shares your healing surge total. Whenever an effect requires your animal companion to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from your total. Whenever you use your second wind, your animal companion also regains hit points equal to your healing surge value. At the end of a short rest, your animal companion regains all its hit points.
    If you die or your animal companion drops to 0 hit points, it disappears as the primal magic that sustains it dissipates. You have two ways of calling your companion back:
    * Minor Action: You take a minor action and lose a healing surge. Doing so causes your animal companion to appear in the nearest unoccupied space, with hit points equal to your healing surge value.
    * Short or Extended Rest: You lose a healing surge at the end of a rest. Doing so causes your animal companion to appear in the nearest unoccupied space, with full hit points.
    As a creature under your control, your animal companion relies on you for strict guidance while you are within 20 squares of it. You take actions so that it can act, and its initiative is the same as yours during an encounter.
    Standard Actions: To take a standard action, your animal companion needs you to take a standard action to command it to do so.
    Move Actions: Whenever you take a move action, your animal companion can also take a move action. Alternatively, you can stay put but take a move action to command your animal companion to take a move action.
    Minor Actions: To take a minor action, your animal companion needs you to take a minor action to command it to do so.
    Free Actions: Your animal companion can take free actions without you taking an action to command it.
    Triggered Actions: If one of your animal companion's triggered actions is triggered, the companion can take that action only if you take the same kind of action to command it to do so. For example, if an enemy adjacent to your companion provokes an opportunity attack from it, you must take an opportunity action to command your companion to make the attack.
    In situations where you can't give commands to your animal companion, it can act independently. For example, if you are unconscious or if you are more than 20 squares away from your companion, it doesn't sit around waiting for you to show up (unless that's what you have previously commanded it to do).
    An animal companion acting independently can take either a standard, a move, or a minor action on its turn. It can also take opportunity actions and free actions, but it cannot take immediate actions.

  <RulesElement name="Companion" type="Information" internal-id="ID_INTERNAL_INFORMATION_COMPANION" source="Core">
Beastmaster rangers, Sentinel druids, and characters with the Arcane Familiar feat gain companions which are selected on this page.
    A Beastmaster Ranger gains a beast companion, chosen from one of these categories: bear, boar, cat, lizard, raptor, serpent, spider, or wolf. These categories do not describe specific animals, but rather groups of similarly themed creatures in the D&amp;D world. You decide the creature's relevant details—its species, physical details, and so forth—making sure they are appropriate for its category and the campaign.
    For example, if your character hails from a swampy region, your lizard companion might be a crocodile. The lizard companion of a ranger from a different region might be a giant monitor lizard or a drake. A beast companion's species doesn't affect its game statistics, which are based on its category and level.
    A Sentinel Druid gains an animal companion associated with the season they chose for their Acolyte of the Natural Cycle class feature.
    The animal companion's level is equal to theirs, and its hit points, defenses, and attacks are determined by the druid's level level, as noted in its stat block.
    The animal companion shares the druid's healing surge total. Whenever an effect requires the animal companion to spend a healing surge, the surge is deducted from the druid's total. 
  
    A familiar is a spirit that accompanies you as your friend and ally. It's not a real creature, and it doesn't need to eat or breathe. The most common type is a creature familiar—a spirit that takes the form of a little animal or monster.

The Beast Mastery class feature is available to any ranger who wishes to gain a loyal beast companion. To select this class feature, you must give up the Prime Shot class feature, and you do not select either the Archer Fighting Style or the Two-Blade Fighting Style.
You gain a beast companion, chosen from one of these categories: bear, boar, cat, lizard, raptor, serpent, spider, or wolf. These categories do not describe specific animals, but rather groups of similarly themed creatures in the D&amp;D world. You decide the creature's relevant details—its species, physical details, and so forth—making sure they are appropriate for its category and the campaign.
	For example, if your character hails from a swampy region, your lizard companion might be a crocodile. The lizard companion of a ranger from a different region might be a giant monitor lizard or a drake. A beast companion's species doesn't affect its game statistics, which are based on its category and level.
	You and your beast companion work so well together that the creature is almost an extension of you. Using your actions in combat, you control your beast companion by issuing it commands.
	Beast Mastery also alters your Hunter's Quarry class feature. When you use Hunter's Quarry, your quarry can be either the enemy nearest to you that you can see or the enemy nearest to your beast companion that you can see. You or your beast companion can deal the extra damage from Hunter's Quarry, but only one of you can deal this extra damage per round.
	Your beast companion is considered a creature and an ally and can be affected by powers. A cleric can heal it with healing word, a warlord can give it a melee basic attack with commander's strike, and so forth. You and your beast companion are treated as separate creatures.
	You can have only one beast companion at a time. You can dismiss your beast companion at any time, but gaining a new one isn't a simple task.The link between a ranger and his or her beast companion is not one of master and servant but of two close friends.
	As part of the training you underwent that allowed you to form a close bond with a beast, you learned the Raise Beast Companion ritual, which allows you to raise your companion from the dead, even if you are otherwise unable to master and perform rituals.

A druid of spring gains a wolf, a cunning, agile hunter filled with energy and determination. Your animal companion obeys your commands without hesitation, making it more responsive to your commands than even the most well-trained beast. The bond also allows you to communicate with your animal companion, enabling you to work together toward mutual goals.
     Your animal companion is considered an ally of you and your allies. It can be affected by powers in the same way as any other creature can be. As a creature under your control, your animal companion relies on you for strict guidance while you are within 20 squares of it. You take actions so that it can act, and its initiative is the same as yours during an encounter.

You gain two of the following abilities of your choice.
Beast Empathy:
The beasts of the wilderness see and know most of what unfolds in their realm. Few folk heed them, but you have learned to understand and interpret their actions and attitudes. Your woodcraft is short of the magical ability to communicate with animals directly, but it is enough to reveal secrets that others miss.
   *You gain a +2 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks against beasts. You can communicate simple concepts and commands to such creatures, though they are under no compulsion to obey you. With a successful Insight check (DC determined by the DM), you can read a creature's body language and vocalizations enough to understand basic messages from it.
Herb Lore:
You have studied the properties of various plants. Even in distant lands your lore serves you well in finding the right leaves and roots to harvest. By brewing a soothing tea or mixing a poultice, you help soothe the aches, bruises, and cuts you and your allies suffer.
   *You and each ally can add 2 to his or her healing surge value when spending heading surges during a short rest. To gain this benefit, you must take the short rest in an area that offers easy access to plants. The additional hit points increase to 4 at 11th level and 6 at 21st level.
Mountain Guide:
You have clambered over steep cliffs and ranged across imposing mountains. Your knack for climbing allows you to pick out the easiest paths up even the most imposing slopes.
   *Whenever you succeed on an Athletics check to climb, you reduce the DC of that climb by 2 for your allies until the end of the encounter. Only allies who see you make the climb gain this benefit.
Watchful Rest:
Long days spent in the wilds have taught you the best way to set up a camp. By picking out an easily defensible spot and carefully positioning your gear, you ensure that you and your allies have the best chance to avoid an ambush.
   *When you take an extended rest, you and any allies also taking the rest do not take the -5 penalty to Perception checks for sleeping.
Wilderness Tracker:
You are an expert at reading the signs of a creature's passage. When you inspect an area, a splintered twig or a trampled leaf is enough for you to glean a significant amount of information. Even the slyest rogues and sneakiest warlocks leave behind some trace of their passage.
   *During a short rest, you can make a Perception check (DC determined by the DM) to inspect the area around you. This area can be as large as 10 squares on a side. If your check succeeds, you determine the number and nature of the creatures that have moved through the area in the past 24 hours.

The world experiences perpetual cycles of life, death, and rebirth. The four seasons are signposts that mark the world's progress through time, each with its own recognizable traits. The mortal races have learned to live in harmony with this cycle, using the bounty of spring, summer, and autumn to enable them to endure the desolation of winter. In you, that harmony manifests itself in a special way. You have learned to harness the greatest power of the natural world: that of primal magic.
     Druids are guardians of the world. They provide guidance to the common folk and tend to villages, towns, and vast stretches of unspoiled land in the same way that a gardener keeps watch over his flowers and vegetables. A druid works to ensure that the natural order remains strong. A wise druid allows a band of hunting goblins to gather food and game for their survival. But if those same goblins wreak havoc purely for the joy of destruction, the druid calls upon primal magic to smite and scatter them. As long as creatures live within the cycle of nature, a druid lives and lets live.
     Druids provide guidance and protection to farmers, wild animals, and plants in equal measure. In a druid's eyes, all living creatures have the same right to live within the world. A druid might help a village plant crops, but then turn against the villagers if they hunt to near extinction the wolves that prey on their cattle. Balance is the key to maintaining nature's integrity.

  You desired more fluidity of form and motion than what the masters taught you, so you reached out to a creature you knew would grant the abilities you seek. By claiming the chaos beast as your totem creature, you can take its form, and, in doing so, the form of any shape that its aberrant mind could imagine. Chaos beasts continually change form, and their strength comes from inflicting changes upon their unwilling foes. In taking their form, such as it is, you grow more powerful. Your body does not move like other creatures. You gain the upper hand by warping your limbs and contorting your joints in unnatural ways, leaving your enemies unable to predict your attacks.

Your extensive use of elemental power exacts a terrible price. What you once thought was a boon born from an understanding of the world's true nature reveals itself to be a curse. Your mortal form becomes compromised as ancient forces that seek entry into the world try to use you as their vessel.
	Exile and Rebirth: Realizing the risk you pose to the natural world, you withdraw from it as far as you can—deep into the Astral Sea. After ages spent sailing the shimmering sea, the elemental energy contained within you finally slips free, transforming you into the primordial power you were destined to become. In this form, raw chaos bleeds from you and surrounds you with a swirling maelstrom. In time, you divide yourself until each mood, hope, and fear becomes distinct. As new versions of you appear in this primordial substance, each claims a share of the protoplasm, shaping it into matter until a new world is born. Thus you germinate the seeds that will become a new reality born from your mortal achievements. Someday it might resemble the world you left behind, or it could be unique in the multiverse. </specific>

Your fate is to peer through the veil of worlds and see reality as it truly is, to behold the wonder and splendor of creation and mold it in whatever way you desire. You have always sensed the inherent possibility in your surroundings, always sensed the energy that wells up from rocks and trees, wind and rain. At one time, you thought such power belonged to the spirit world. The more you studied, the more you realized that the spirits are only one part of a much grander story that began when the primordials merged form with substance. 
	This realization has helped you to harness the latent energy in all things, to call it forth, and to use it as you will. You realize that such knowledge is dangerous: Its reckless exploitation could complete the task the primordials began so long ago—that of unraveling the fabric of creation. It falls to you to husband your knowledge, to keep it safe and carry it with you until the end of your days.
	As a Master Hierophant, you have perfected the blending of elemental and primal magic. One feeds into the other, and their fusion energizes a great cycle through which you can transcend your mortality and become something greater. Fire and wind, earth and water are yours to command. They serve you as you carve your name in history. As you progress up the ladder of knowledge, exposure to elemental power slowly changes you; your mortality is stripped away until you become something akin to the primordials of old.

You are immune to disease. You also stop aging. Time cannot kill you, though injury might. Unless some calamity befalls you, you retain your present age and appearance.
Finally, once per encounter as a minor action, you can speed your recovery by placing your body into a state of suspended animation. While in suspended animation, you are unconscious, have regeneration 5 while bloodied, and can make saving throws at both the start and the end of your turns. Your suspended animation ends at the end of the encounter or when you choose to end it at the end of your turn.

Though most people associate the Feywild with arcane magic, it is also home to some of the most pristine regions of natural growth across all of the planes. Primeval forests sit untouched by civilization since their creation, alongside mountainsides and hilltops upon which no intelligent being has ever set foot. It should be no surprise that there are those who have chosen a life of protection and guardianship over the natural treasures of the plane.
As with all druids, protectors are the masters of The magic first shared with mortals by the primal spirits. The primal spirits might dwell chiefly in the world, but the druids of the Feywild hear their call and heed their guidance even in the fey realm. Though it might seem as though the presence of the primal spirits in the Feywild would be at a diminished level, in truth primal magic is often among the most effective tools to use in a plane infused with arcane magic. Where many of the dangers of the Feywild have evolved over the eons to deal with the omnipresent nature of arcane threats, primal magic is still untamed and unanticipated by most creatures of the plane.
As a protector, you learned your primal magic from a druid circle, which trained you to protect nature and punish those that would do it harm. By ensuring that the land, the water, and the sky inhabited by ihe primal spirits is protected, you become a staunch defender of those who live in harmony with nature and show respect for their natural surroundings.
You might go out into the world to seek new experiences and powerful artifacts of primal magic. Though you will stray far from your druid circle in the course of your adventures, your efforts reflect on its goals, and you will use the knowledge it has granted you to battle despoilers and defilers throughout the world and across the planes.

	  <Flavor> Each protector druid belongs to a druid circle, a group of like-minded servants of nature. A druid circle bears some similarity to the orders of clerics and other servants of the gods. However, the druids of your circle serve a different entity as they revere and protect the natural world.
	  A druid circle might be a secret society of masters of primal magic, congregating to enact an agenda known only to themselves. A circle is just as likely to devote itself solely to the communities that arise along the fringe of the wilderness, acting as mystics and advisors while they channel the wisdom of the natural world. Whatever its motive and structure, each druid circle is known for the wisdom of its older members, whose counsel is sought by influential members of all cultures and races.
	  A druid circle has a hierarchy much like that of a religious organization. At 1st level, you are an initiate of your circle. As you gain levels, you improve your standing. Even as your adventuring career brings you experience and prestige, it grants you influence with your fellow druids. With the growth of your mastery of primal magic, you gain greater understanding of the secrets kept by your order. Many druid circles guard mysteries of primal power said to have been handed down in the first days following the Dawn War. The higher you rise through the ranks, the more of these pieces of ancient lore are revealed to you. </Flavor>

You count the creatures of the natural world as your allies. With magic learned from the elders of your druid circle, you can call one of those creatures to you at any time and across any distance. With this ally at your side, you can tip the balance of combat in your favor. 
	Because of this feature, you do not gain a druid daily attack power at level 5, 9, 15, 19, 25, or 29. Instead, you gain the summon natural ally power at level 1. At level 5, you can use summon natural ally twice per day, and at level 9, you can use it three times per day.

The great primal spirit known as the Steadfast Henge is one of the most ancient powers of the mortal world, its existence dating back to the days immediately following the Dawn War. In those days, the foundations of creation were often unstable, and the Feywild intruded upon the world for a short time. Among the primal spirits present at this intrusion was the Steadfast Henge, which has since become a patron to druid circles of both the Feywild and the natural world.
