      <specific name="Characteristics"> Batrachians who gather together join communities, oftentimes with pureblood members of their kind (other deep ones such as kuo toa and sahuagin) and give in to the overwhelming urge to worship the aquatic death gods they revere. The worship of the Old One is irresistible to the batrachians.
Those few who are able to cast off the racial imperative to enter the deep oceans and spread the faith of the Old One tend to make good adventurers, although they must sulk at the edge of human communities, and are forced to always seek out a source of water in which to immerse them. Such a character has limits, but can be a clever and challenging personality to role play. </specific>
      <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Batrachians begin their lives as humans or other demihumans who soon discover a taint in the family line, one which twists and warps them over time in to hunched, aquatic beings with traits not unlike a fish, octopous, or other deep sea creature. This mutation is dramatic, and the human elements of the batrachian are often obliterated by the time the transformation is complete. </specific>

      <specific name="Characteristics"> Ghuls tend to group in small societies, usually dwelling in catacombs and sometime even amongst their undead cousins. Wherever humans reside in large numbers, ghuls are sure to have a small community living on the dregs of man.
Ghul adventurers are usually fed up with the secretive, cannibalistic way of their kind and take to the road, seeking adventure and fame to make up for the curse they were either born to or infected with. Few ghul adventurers maintain good relations with their own kind, as they traditionally eschew their race's vile ways.
Ghouls usually worship one of two different deities: either the deity that promises salvation and an ending of their half-undead nature, or the other one, which promises them dark powers in exchange for servitude. Ereshkigal is an excellent deity for ghuls to worship, although some ghuls who despise their nature may follow Nergal as well. </specific>
      <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Ghuls are a half human, half ghoul race that is readily mistaken for their more common undead relatives. Ghuls are, in fact, a species that spawned from a rare corruption of normal men who succumbed to a terrible disease, which changed them in to living but gaunt, charnel cousins of their undead relatives. </specific>

      <specific name="Short Description"> Ghuls gain strength from cannibalism. </specific>
      <specific name="Level"> 1 </specific>
Ghuls gain strength from cannibalism. They do not need to eat fresh meat; there is much truth to the idea of ghuls seeking out corpses and carrion. Once per day, Ghuls who spend a standard action cannibalizing a corpse may activate a healing surge.
If a ghul goes a day without using this power, then he loses the ability to use 1 healing surge per day. This accumulates until he resumes his cannibalistic ways.

Ghuls gain strength from cannibalism. They do not need to eat fresh meat; there is much truth to the idea of ghuls seeking out corpses and carrion. Once per day, Ghuls who spend a standard action cannibalizing a corpse may activate a healing surge.

If a ghul goes a day without using this power, then he loses the ability to use 1 healing surge per day. This accumulates until he resumes his cannibalistic ways.

You have learned to master the powers of darkness and are practically an unliving embodiment of the undead. You are now considered undead, immortal, and gain resist necrotic 15. You gain vulnerable radiant 15, and are now fully affected by all effects that target undead. 
   Your appearance has changed to certifiably undead, and you no longer radiate any internal body heat. To maintain a humanlike appearance you must invest in 100 GPs worth of products each month to treat your body to preservative fluids in order to sustain a semblance of your former appearance. 
	 If you choose not to do so, then you gain a -5 penalty to any disguise checks and are obviously undead to those you interact with in the future. If you maintain a semblance of life, then you must attempt a disguise check (thievery) of DC 30 to look like a member of the living. The DC goes up by 5 for each month you miss your regimen of life-like sustaining cosmetic and preservative treatments. If you miss them for a year or more, you are no longer able to disguise your undead appearance.

The dream summoner is a necromancer who has perfected the art of summoning unholy entities from beyond, or raising new undead from corpses both fresh and ancient. This fascination the dread summoner feels for his creations is macabre at the least and madness-inducing, typically. Like other necromancers, he is often shunned by more pleasant company, and prefers to keep his own with those he has brought back in to the world.

The servants of Ereshkigal worship the oldest venerated death goddess in most worlds, or a similar deity. The high priest has taken on the burden of both advancing the faith and furthering the interests of his dark goddess. Ereshkigal favors the harvesting of souls for her underworld, and prefers undead who are under the control of her flock, doing her bidding. As such, the black cultist has many duties in harvesting souls and raising followers for her.
   Black cultists manifest for many evil deities of the underworld, although Ereskigal is among the oldest of such deities.

Nergal was one of the few demigods to strike out, find love in the afterworld, and then still manage to escape. As a consort to Ereshkigal, Nergal is forever bound to the underworld of Irkalla, and in time, through his immortal deeds, his followers have achieved a curious connection to the realm of the dead, as well. Nergal is one of several gods who see themselves as guardians of the gates of death, deities who have walked both paths and seek to insure that death and life do not cross.
   Death hunters have developed their necromantic skills so that they may further the ends of Nergal, by stemming the tide of undeath which wells out from Irkalla and other realms in the afterlife. They strike down the undead with wild abandon, offering up their destruction as sacrificial offerings to Nergal.

Once per day as a standard action the dread summoner may call upon a number of undead servants, which appear adjacent to the summoner, or as close to him as possible. The dread summoner must spend a standard action concentrating and make a Wisdom check. He gains summoning points as indicated below:

Wis Check Summoning Points
01-15       1 summoning point
16-20       2 summoning points
21-25       3 summoning points
26-30       4 summoning points
31-35       5 summoning points
Every 5+  +1 pt. per 5 over rolled

Summoning points are spent to acquire followers. The dread summoner can spend them as follows:

Value     Undead
1           1d4+2 drudge skeletons
1           1d4+1 Zombie Rotters
1           1d2 skeletons

2           1 Wight
3           1 Wraith
4           1 Zombie Hulk

The dread summoner must spend his standard action and a movement action to control his servants (he can move on the movement action, but his standard action is spent controlling his servants). He must also spend a minor action concentrating on maintaining control. At the end of the encounter, or if he relinquishes control of the minions (voluntarily or otherwise, due to unconsciousness for example) then the minions are no longer controlled and become hostile (reverting to full DM control). The dread summoner may, as a standard action, dismiss the undead instead, returning them to the outer darkness, true death, or whatever form of dismissal is most appropriate.

Life stealers are especially proficient as stealing soul energy. Whenever the life stealer uses an action point to gain an extra action, he may also choose one other target within 10 squares. The life stealer immediately spends a healing surge, recovering hit points equal to his surge value. The chosen target immediately takes damage equal to the healing surge value just activated.

Night reavers are especially proficient in slicing limbs from bodies. Anytime the night reaver bloodies a foe, he may spend an action point to gain a second action and make an immediate attack, and the foe is stunned until the end of the night reaver's next turn. If the foe is reduced to 0 hit points with this attack then the foe is automatically considered killed and decapitated and the night reaver may immediately spend a healing surge.

Death hunters often rely on arms as much as spells. If the slayer is not proficient in one martial weapon already, he may choose one to gain proficiency with. When making a melee attack, the death hunter may use his Intelligence modifier to hit and as a damage bonus to all basic and melee attacks. He always deals ongoing 5 + Intelligence modifier damage against undead (save ends).

Ruler of the underworld of Irkalla, Ereshkigal is the oldest title of a venerable Mesoptoamian goddess, one of the oldest goddesses of death in the world. She carried many titles, including "Lady of the Great Earth" and "Lady of the Great Below." She was enamored with Nergal, who she took as husband, tying the more earthly god to her dark underworld.
   In a tradition seen in some other mythologies (see Hel) Ereshkigal may have been an unwilling patron of the dead, spirited away and forced in to duty by the god Enlil.
   Irkalla is a dark realm, the place to which all dead things go, and through it runs the underworld river of Kur, not unlike the Styx.

Called by some "The Raging King" or "The Furious One," Nergal is often depicted as a ferocious lionheaded king with a powerful mace. He is a solar deity with warlike aspects, but dually linked with the underworld where he rules as king beside Ereshkigal. Together, they have a son, the god Ninazu.
   In fantasy realms, Nergal makes an excellent transitional deity, a god who insures that the sun rises each morning, even as it dies each evening with the dusk. He makes a prominent figure for those who desire to police the boundaries between living and dead, insuring that the undead are properly destroyed, and that the gateways between Irkalla and the living world are not left open.
   Nergal remains a feared deity, one who is venerated less than he is feared. His dedicates are few in number, but those who fear him are many.

Dwelling in the ever dark, cold realm of Metnal, Ah Puch is one of the more ferocious and disturbing demon gods of Mayan mythology, a forbidding, rotting corpse covered in copper bells and occasionally manifesting either with the head of an owl, an animal symbolic of the Mayan underworld. The sound of an owl in a region held sway by Ah Puch's worship is an omen of death.
   When moving among mortals, Ah Puch is said to seek out likely victims to carry screaming in to Xibalba. Some stories suggest that if you make enough noises, shrieking like the dead are clawing at you, then he will pass on your house, figuring one of his demonic servants is already dispatching you.
   Ah Puch can play a role in any game which requires a boogey-man like lord of the dead. He is a disturbing figure, and may be demonic, ruling over the many lesser demonic gods of Xibalba.

The terrible demon god Mictlantecuhtli was the entity to which many blood sacrifices and cannibal rites were committed among the Aztecs, to appease the dreaded god. Together with a cadre of death gods which included Chalmecatl, his wife Mictecacihuatl and others, he ruled from the underworld of Mictlan, in a house with no windows.
   Mictlantecuhtli was depicted in the guise of a blood-drenched skeleton with sharpened teeth, his skull adorned with a crown owl feathers, wearing a necklace strung with human eyes. His image is terrifying, and his idols nearly as much so.
   In the underworld of Mictlan, Mictlanteculhtli presided over the triumvirate of souls, as the Aztecs believed all souls fell in to one of the three categories: those who died normal deaths, those who died ignominiously, and those who died heroically (be it in battle or child birth).
   Mictlanteculhtli figures in to Aztec creation myth, as well, and in an interesting twist it is evident that the Aztecs believed that the underworld of the dead existed before mortals did. The twin deities Quetzalcoatl and Xolotl were said to have sought out the bones of older, fallen gods in the dark realms of Mictlan, but Mictlanteculhtli tried to thwart the theft, and in doing so Quetzalcoatl spilled his sack of bones across the world, creating man and other mortal beings.

Camazotz was an anthropomorphized bat demon, a horrendous minion from the House of Night in Xibalba, serving under Ah Puch. His house was said to contain tens of thousands of bats, with razor sharp teeth and claws like himself. He has been variously depicted as an immense bat or a human with the head of a bat. Much of his encounter with the mythic hero twins Hunhunapu and Xbalanque during their descent to Xibalba is written of Camazotz in the texts of the Popol Vuh codex.
   Like Ah Puch, Camazotz is a very demonic being, with a malice toward the living, and he, his cult, and minions would make excellent adversaries for a DM seeking a new, evil god to spring upon his world.

The Greek god Hades was lord of the dead and ruler of the netherworld, commonly referred to by his own name. Here lay the river Styx, the guardian three-headed Cerberus, the ferryman Charon, and other legendary figures of the underworld. Likewise, Hades rested upon his ebony throne, aided by the lesser chthonic gods Hypnos, Thanatos and others in his judicious rule over the dead.
   Hades had a wife, in the form of Persephone, who he stole away to be his queen (notice the pattern here). Even when he was forced to release her back to the surface world by Zeus, he gave her a tainted pomegranate, which upon being eaten by the poor woman bound her to the underworld and Hades forever. Death is no object to love for an underworld god, apparently.
   Hades was disliked by all, and sacrifices to the god usually accompanied pain and suffering to appease his dark tastes. Even uttering his name was considered bad luck, a way of attracting the dark god's attentions.
   While Hades has some relationship to Dis Pater of Roman and Gaulish belief, but manifests in Roman belief as the distinctly separate entity Pluto.

Dis Pater, meaning literally the "Father of Riches" in references to the wealth beneath the soil of the ground, was a lord of the dead adopted in to Roman worship from their connection to Gaulish and Celtic sources, where the deity may have been known as In Dagda, or by other lost names.
   The Romans held an interesting fascination for this god, without which little might be known about his Gaulish origins. He was believed to be one of six underworld deities, and some Gauls believed he was their ancient ancestor.
   Dis Pater would make an excellent deity for a barbarian or other sort of character, or a more civilized follower who is fascinated by this barbarian god.

Born the daughter of Loki, lord of mischief and the giantess Angrboda, Hel is the Norse goddess of the underworld, ruler of Helheim. Hel is variously depicted as a half-dead being, both living and dead, sometimes hag-like.
   Hel was tossed in to the abyss of Helheim by the Norse gods, and therefore is likely an unwilling denizen of the dark realm. She deals with the recently deceased from her great hall of Eljudnir, where she determines the fates of the wicked, the sickly and elderly. Hel does not deal with those who pass on to a valorous death, to fight beside Odin in the ranks of the Einheriar, carried to their destiny by the Valkyries.
   As is typical of Norse myth, Hel is a dark and foreboding figure, and characteristic of the fatalism so prevalent in Norse myth. This makes an excellent deity for necromancers and clerics who want a fatalistic, "count yourself lucky" sort of attitude toward life.

Kali is the grim consort of the god Shiva, a curious deity who serves to aid those who strive for the true knowledge of god by destroying ignorance and lesser things. She is a terrifying entity, with deep, malicefilled eyes, four arms, a bloody sword in one hand and a severed demon's head in another. Her garb consist's of a necklace of human heads and a skirt made from human arms. She is the redeemer of the universe, the one who slays all that stands in the way of truth.
   Followers of Kali in a fantasy realm will add an interesting and violent aspect to the quest for knowledge, which may well suit a necromancer, who deals at length with beliefs of life an death.

The Cthulhu Mythos define many ancient, cosmic entities to whom mankind is but a gnat. Such entities would very likely manifest in multiple realities, and there is no reason at all that the Old Ones don't manifest somewhere in your own fantasy world.
   Old Ones are known for being large, ancient entities, god-like in nature but simply unfathomably powerful on a cosmic scale relative to humans. In their dark dreams they send forth visions to those susceptible, either evil or mad beings who are prone to their worship in exchange for power. The Old Ones were imprisoned long ago in an ill defined conflict with another, equally vast power, and they patiently await the time when they will at last be free once more.
   Introducing the Old Ones in to your setting can lead to some interesting new twists in the story line, for their very existence in your world both dooms it and eclipses the petty interests of local pantheons, assuming all gods are not merely humanized, misunderstood attempts to grasp the trues significance of these vast, unfathomable entities. Batrachian and ghul necromancers might find the worship of the Old Ones to be much to their liking!

The caster of this ritual must have access to an undead creature which has been restrained for the duration of the ritual. Upon completing the ritual, he must make a skill check against a DC equal to 15 + the level of the creature being bound. He can not attempt to bind elite or solo creatures. If the ritual is successful, then the creature will serve and obey the necromancer as if it were a pet for one hour, after which is will be free to do as it wishes again. If the skill check fails, the creature can not be bound, and further efforts are useless.
   The component cost for the spell will equal 250 gp times the level of the creature targeted by the ritual.

The caster of this ritual spell takes enchanted elements, including special transformed clay, to produce a living body. The body can then be imbued with a spirit of the caster's choice--a dead character, usually, but the DM must agree that the spirit is still accessible to the caster; i.e. has not been resurrected elsewhere, reincarnated, or returned as an undead being.
   The base chance of success is DC 40. If successful, then at the end of the ritual, the spirit in question has been restored to a new functioning body. The homunculus will shift to the preferred race of the inhabiting spirit, although a different physical form of the same approximate size and shape can be chosen, if desired.
   Should the caster roll a natural 1 on his skill check, then the DM may rule something unusual happens: more than one spirit possesses the body, or a different spirit enters the form, or some other unusual event.

Through dark rituals you gather a corpse and imbue it with unlife. This spell is extremely powerful, and should be very, very difficult to find, and never learned spontaneously. DMs beware!
   Any undead can potentially be created using this spell. The caster must have at least 1 body present, and must have a specific undead entity in mind. The base DC for success depends on the following formula:
      Minions: DC=15+level of monster
      Normal: DC=20+level of monster
      Elite: DC=25+level of monster
      Solo: DC=40+level of monster
   For minions and normals, the caster creates 1 additional minion for every 5 points over the target DC he rolls on his skill check, so long as he has enough available bodies.
   The undead created are not under the caster's control, and unless precautions have been taken (such as the Ward against Undead ritual) they will turn on their own creator.

   Upon completing the ritual and making an arcana check, the ritual caster summons forth a number of undead in total levels equal to the skill check result, or four times that number of levels in minions. The undead will remain in service for one week or until destroyed, At the end of the week they return to lifelessness.
   During the time they are risen, the undead will serve the general commands of the ritual summoner, but will otherwise act independently.

The Greater Curse of Unlife is a lengthy ritual prepared and cast by a necromancer preparing for the worst. Whether it be death by natural or unnatural means, the necromancer is planning for his own demise...and return!
   The ritual spell takes a week to prepare, but once cast will remain in effect until the demise of the necromancer. After he perishes (fails mortality checks and/or does not return in any way, shape or form) the character affected by the spell will rise again at midnight following his demise. He will now gain the undead property, as defined in the MM, and be affected by any and all powers as if he were undead.

With a wave of your hand you imbue unlife in to fleshy bits, sculpting them in to a small and evil servant. You imbue dead flesh in to a form of life. It forms to create a permanent tiny undead entity which will function as a small and loyal pet and servant. The homunculus has the following effects for necromancers:

* Dark Vision: The Necromancer gains dark vision while the homunculus is within 10 squares.
* Shared Vision: the necromancer can see through the eyes of the homunculus if it is within 1 mile of his person. He may use dark vision when employing this effect.
* Recovered Energy: The necromancer may sacrifice the homunculi as a minor action and use a healing surge.
* Spell Conduit: the necromancer may enact any spell he desires through the homunculi as if he were in its square, so long as he can see through its eyes.

Homunculi Statistics

* Ability Scores: Strength 5, Constitution 10, Dexterity 10, Intelligence 10, Wisdom 10, Charisma 2
* Size: tiny

   There are three types of grafts that can be found, based on how difficult it will be to remove the device, once applied. The DM can decide on a case-by-case basis whether a graft is basic, symbiotic, or cursed when he hands it out, or he can decide that all grafts fall in to one of the following categories.
   Basic Grafts: The device can be removed, but this requires a standard action and the expenditure of a healing surge. It is a minor action to put on such a graft, and costs nothing.
   Symbiotic Grafts: These grafts bond physically with the wearer, and are difficult to remove. The device can be pulled free only after A Remove Graft ritual spell has been cast upon the device and user.
   Cursed Grafts: A cursed graft is one which actively seeks to disparage its removal, and will harm the host if he or she tries to do so. Any attempt to remove a graft in one of the previously described methods causes the wearer to lose one healing surge and take damage equal to his surge value. The only way to remove a cursed graft is to destroy it, by means that become available according to the campaign, or by a disenchant magic item spell that beats a target DC equal to 10 + the level of the graft. Any failure in any attempt leads to the aforementioned damage being dealt to the wearer. Death, of course, is also a quick means to loosening a cursed graft.
