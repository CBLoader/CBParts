    <specific name="Power">Power (Daily): Immediate Reaction. Use this ability when you are struck by a melee attack. The attack misses and you immediately fey step, leaving behind a life-like decoy comprised leaves, vines, and other vegetation. Your attacker's strike causes the decoy to break apart, scattering its components into the air. Enemy creatures in squares adjacent to the decoy become dazed (save ends). Special: You may spend a healing surge when using this power. If you do, you do not regain Hit points as normal. Instead enemy creatures adjacent to the decoy become restrained instead of dazed (save ends). </specific>
