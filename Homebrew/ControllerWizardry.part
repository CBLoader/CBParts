	  <specific name="Effect">Lingering Flame : Creates a zone of heat and dwindling fire, covering the area of the burst, that lasts until the end of your next turn. Each creature that enters the zone or ends their turn within the area takes Intelligence modifier fire damage.(only once on their turn).</specific>
	  <specific name="Effect">Sulfurous Smoke : The above zone is filled with light smoke which impairs the senses of those entering or within it causes creatures to treat all targets as having partial concealment till the end of their next turn.</specific>
	The most famous evocation spell ever devised, fireball is known—and feared—by folk who have never even seen it cast. Whether turning a horde of orc or goblin warriors to cinders in the blink of an eye, or used as the catalyst that unleashes an inferno in a tinder-dry building, fireball is a potent addition to any mage's arsenal of magic. The after math can be none too pleasant either.
