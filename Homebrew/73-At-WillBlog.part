In the deserts of Lahan, far to the south of the Haumean Theocracy stands a lone stone structure by a large oasis.  What was at one point a temple to Pelor has been converted by its inhabitants to a place of personal training and dedication known as the Oasis of the Southern Wind.  Within these walls, a small handful of monks train any who are hardy enough to survive in the Southern Wind disciplines of hand-to-hand fighting.

The Southern Wind style is unusual among many of the known unarmed fighting disciplines.  Rather than focus on powerful strikes and complex acrobatics, the harshness of the conditions under which these students train push them to develop a style that emphasizes minimal effort, misdirection and controlling the enemy's position.  Inspired by the constant heat and winds, the Southern Wind style means to wear its opponent down, forcing it to tire out first and make mistakes.  Practitioners of the style can seem weak or unimpressive to watch, but those who have squared off against it will often seek to talk things out first before being beaten and humiliated by a man who just seems to stand there and do nothing.

The first recorded practitioner of what is now recognized as the Southern Wind combat style was a half-elf by the name of Aelar Forene.  Aelar was always a contemplative type; the constant ringing of bells and calls to worship by the many temples of his home nation made it difficult for him to find the sort of spiritual equilibrium he desired.  He eventually left Haumea, seeking the most isolated and quiet place he could find.  Aelar did in fact find such a place in the abandoned temple, but its location left much to be desired.  In order to obtain necessary supplies and goods to survive in the desert, Aelar became a bounty hunter of sorts, tracking down and subduing enemies of the various faiths of Haumea.  This line of work, combined with the constant stress of the desert begat the Southern Wind unarmed fighting style.

The first students of the Oasis were other similar hunters from divine backgrounds, but Aelar quickly found that the aggressive, confrontational approach that many of the gods encouraged did not mesh well with his training.  Thus he came to require that students be free of religious or worldly obligation in order to better understand the lessons he had to teach.  In time, the Oasis lost its strongly divine bent, instead championing the strength of the individual over the power granted by otherworldly beings.  The Oasis, however, still accepts the occasional contract from Haumean temples in honor of its past.

The current Grand Abbott is an elf known as Bren Autunlif.  He was reported to be something of a lunatic prior to joining the Oasis.  It seems the solitude has helped him control his tumultuous mind.  There are other rumors that Bren is also telepathic and his 'lunacy' was merely an inundation of surrounding thought, but it has not yet been confirmed or denied.

One of the most dominant swordfighting styles in Jiaolong's fighting tournament scene, Liquid Swordfighting focuses on movement and deceptive flowing swordplay to confuse and harry opponents.  Pioneered by a master from the infamous Shodanng clan, finding a master of this style is difficult but offers the rewards of a unique and powerful set of techniques.

Student of the Liquid Sword must study not only physical movements.  They learn to increases and harness their own internal energies, and also learn the intricacies of water movements upon which the style is based.

Water is formless; it can absorb and then surround any form of matter.  When moved it can become a crushing battering force or it can become as supple and ungraspable as air.  The mysteries of the water become a prime concern for students of this sword fighting style.  Personality changes often occur, as knowing the subtleties of water introduces on to a more contemplative frame of mind.

The Destroyer ruled the southeastern kingdoms of Thampai through willpower and strength. His name was a testament to his unique style of fighting and warfare he used to claim his empire.  Fighting with no weapons, he utilized every part of every limb of his body to attack his foes. His devastating blows with elbows and kicks proved most terrible to his foes. His cruel style gladly took hits in order to deliver punishment of his own; the Destroyer gladly took a punch or sword slash or hammer blow to break an opponent's arm or leg.

As he rose to power others followed in his wakestudying his attacks and codifying them into a formal style.  Though he never recognized the style as his, the style became popular throughout his empire and soon his army and his people grew to be feared in distant kingdoms.  Eventually the Destroyer's fighting was imported to Jiaolong.

The style appealed instantly to both fighters and the audience in the fighting pits. Students rushed to learn the Destroyer's brutal art. Most were turned away, unable to display the required toughness or skill demanded of them by their teachers.  So it remains that though Destroyer warriors are popular, there are relatively few of them that can master the rigors of this art.  Many styles seek to avoid or mitigate damage, where the art of the destroyer only mitigates damage by enduring it.  Practitioners learn to take damage to deal damage; the height of the art is to lure an opponent in for a manuever which can break his  body in some way. from their the bruising and crushing attacks continue.

Savage kicks to the leg that eventually render an opponent unable to stand,slashing elbows that opens cuts on the head, rib-breaking kicks and knees - these are all the weapons that the Destroyer bestows upon those who use this style.

Few who learn the Destroyer's art learn his fate until they share it;  The Destroyer's body gave way under the stress and damage of his method of fighting. In his last days the warrior king could not stand nor feed himself.  He sat on his throne as a mere figure head in his last days, his body deprived prematurely of tis vital force.  This is the fate of all those who walk the Destroyer's path, but many consider this a fine price to pay for the power granted them.

Drunkards can be found in every tavern and watering hole in civilized lands, and more than a few tents and huts in the less civilized areas. While most heavy drinkers are harmless alcoholics or sad individuals seeking the solution to life's problems at the bottom of a glass, some rare few are adventurers.

There is an innate bond between adventurers and taverns: many heroes got their start adventuring being approached with a quest while in a bar or answering a call for aid tacked onto the wall. Many adventuring companies operate out of the local tap house, dividing their treasure between drinks and recuperating between quests over a pint. In some lands it is not an uncommon sight to see a group of retired adventurers comparing scars and reminiscing of old times. Many adventurers end their careers in a tavern. Some collapse into drink after repeated failure and death, while others end their wanderings through owning and operating a tavern: investing their fortunes in a place similar to the one that got them started on their heroic path.

Drunkard heroes come from all walks of life. Some unwittingly fall into the grasp of alcohol, others surrender to liquid temptation, and a rare few are skilled combatants able to augment their talents through drink. Anyone can become a drunkard, and many adventurers have found themselves drawn to this path in the middle of their career. Responsibility can weigh heavily on heroes - especially those who have had greatness thrust onto them - driving them to drink. Failure often leads to depression and consumption, especially with the death of close comrades.

Common folk innately dislike drunkards, believing them to be wastrels or untrustworthy. There is the assumption that drunkards spend much of their money on alcohol and do not care about their responsibilities. There is also the belief that drunkards are wasting their talent and potential, that they would be more than they are if not for the drink. Sometimes this is not entirely untrue.

This theme (obviously) requires the character to become drunk on a regular basis.  Being intoxicated is treated like a disease. It uses the standard disease track with the following additions:
* Drinks: Imbibing drinks will move the character down the Intoxication track via attacks vs. Fortitude.  See the Specialty Drinks gear in the Adventuring Gear shop for drink types and effects.
* Checks: Endurance checks are made after each short rest (not extended rests) and used to improve your condition (Hard DC). You cannot worsen through failed Endurance checks.
* Good Night's Sleep: Taking an extended rest moves you to the Hung Over state.
* Sober-up: As normal, a Heal check can be used in place of an Endurance check.
* Cured: A successful check at the Hung-over state removes the disease.

The Intoxication track is as follows:
&lt;table&gt;Inebriation	Penalties
Hung Over	The drinker takes a -1 penalty to Perception checks
Tipsy	The drinker takes a -1 penalty to all skill checks
Drunk	The drinker is slowed takes a -2 penalty to all skill checks
Hammered	The drinker is dazed, slowed and takes a -3 penalty to all skill checks
Falling Down	As Hammered and at the start of each turn, the drinker makes a saving throw.   If failed, the drinker falls unconscious (save ends).&lt;/table&gt;

Arcane magic has few talented practitioners within the world, each creating powerful effects and dweomers in the material planes.  While intelligence and skill are the hallmarks of arcane power, there is also room for inheritance - some individuals pass powerful magical effects from themselves to their kin. The descendants of such mages are born with inherent magical knacks and quirks, without needing to learn anything other than control of these special abilities.

Ironblood mages are descendants of a bloodline that defies the typical abhorrence mages have for heavy metallic armor.  Ironblood mages encase themselves in plate armor to create arcane resonance that amplifies magical effects.  Ironblood mages and warlocks live inside their armor, sommetimes mistaken for men or women of arms before they release an eldritch blast at their enemies.

Ironblood usually are part of a larger clan or family of arcanists. The Ironblood tend to create tightly regimented and hierarchal societies which you adventurer will have some place in.  Advancement is based on the power and skill one uses to defeat those above them in the hierarchy.

You are proficient with chain, scale and plate armor.  You may use arcane daily powers only when you are wearing metallic heavy armor.

The empire has fallen, and the appointed officials have either disappeared or become so corrupt and unreliable that they are now worse than the criminals they're supposed to protect the people from. In times like this, the rights of the people are upheld by private citizens who risk their lives in the defense of others. A small fee, far less than the bribe it would take just to get a watchman's attention, is all it takes to hire a member of the Thieftaker's Guild. 

They can find and bring in anyone; the man that killed your husband, the thief that stole the necklace your grandmother left you, or the lad that got your daughter in the family way. They do whatever they have to in order to find their target, they know the streets and just as importantly, they know how to fight dirty. They know every trick in the repertoire of thieves and muggers, from the sucker punch to the eye-gouge, and they'll gladly use it to bring their target down.

Thieftakers rely on speed and cunning in their fighting, and so classes which exemplify these features often make successful Thieftakers. Fighters, Blackguards, and Rangers are all skilled practitioners of martial prowess and guile, but Rogues and Assassins have spent a lifetime honing the back-alley skills that make Thieftakers such a danger to the criminal element.

Level 5 Feature: Years of investigation have given you a keen insight into how to find what you need, aided by a simple code that keeps others from understanding overheard snippets of your conversation. You gain a +2 bonus to Streetwise and a Secret Language. This language can only be understood by you and those you teach it to. This language requires five extended rests to teach.

Level 10 Feature: You've never let a criminal get away before, and this one won't be the first. You gain a +1 bonus to speed.

The Knights of the Wyvern Path are spoken of in story and song by village storytellers and court bards alike, however their stories are considered to be no more than ancient myth by the educated. These educated naysayers are wrong this time, however.

The Knights of the Wyvern Path, know as Dragoons, were an order of warriors that served Bahamut during an ancient empire from before the era of either Bael Turath or Arkhosia. They were tasked with protecting the empire from the working of Tiamat, and they extensively studied the fighting styles of her chromatic dragons to learn their weaknesses and strength. Their fighting style is derived from the strengths they observed in their studies. Not gifted the divine powers of the clergy, they practiced a secret fighting style designed to mimic the battle prowess of chromatic dragons. After years of practice, this devotion gifted them with a link to the Elemental Chaos whereby they could draw on the same power that flowed through the veins of the dragons they superbly imitated.

Their noble order fell along with the end of the empire, but their fighting style lived on in secret. The details can be found hidden away in the remains of long-forgotten monestaries, or held in secret by the high priest of many a temple of Bahamut. 

Any melee warrior can make a superb Dragoon, but warriors which clad themselves in heavy armor tend to favor the Dragoon's fighting style more than any other. Fighters, Paladins, and Battleminds make superb followers of the Wyvern Path. Dragoons tend to develop an attachment to one particular weapon, so characters that specialize in wielding a large variety of weapon types may not enjoy the full benefits of the Dragoon.

Level 5 Feature: Dragoons are famous for their powerful jumps, and all are required to learn a new language during their schooling. You gain a +2 bonus to Athletics checks and learn the Draconic language. If you already know the Draconic language, you learn another language other than Supernal.

Level 10 Feature: Choose a weapon type; you gain a +2 bonus to damage with weapons of that type.

You have mastered the technique of drunken boxing, a fighting style that specializes in staggering, unpredictable movements. Your enemies never know when you are going to strike or which way you will move. While sober you are a fearsome foe, and only become more deadly and agile after a few drinks. Care is needed: while you are skilled at fighting while tipsy it is easy to drink too much and risk passing out.

When your character is in a fight, he can accumulate Drive. When a character accumulates 10 or more points of drive, he has reached his limit. Drive can be accumulated in the following ways:

Spend a healing surge: 1 point
Miss all targets with an attack (at-will or encounter): 1 point
Miss all targets with an attack (daily): 2 points
Becoming bloodied: 2 points
Getting dropped: 6 points
Spend an action point for drive (no other action point effects are triggered): 8 points

When your character reaches 10 points, he has reached his limit. You can activate the limit by either using your second wind, or expending a standard action. Reaching your limit grants you a +2 limit bonus to attack rolls and defenses until the end of the encounter. You recover hit points as if you spend two healing surges. It also grants access to your limit break, which modifies your character's existing powers or grants new abilities. A limit break can be triggered even if your character has been dropped, though he cannot use a second wind and must expend a standard action to do so.

Drive resets to 0 during a short or extended rest.

    <Prereqs> ~HELLROCK_DUERGAR </Prereqs>
    <specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>
    <specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
    <specific name="Characteristics"> Though all duergar have the infernal blood in their veins, one clan have embraced their infernal heritage fully, walking further down this abyssal path. While other dwarves and duergar mine for precious stones, the hellrock duergar mine for arcane knowledge and hidden mysteries. They have already unlocked the mysteries of their heritage, transforming the appearance of a hellrock duergar. 

This clan of infernal dwarves derive their name from the special metal that they mine. Hellrock smoulders perpetually, and is used by the duergar for everything from weapons and armor to rituals and building material. No matter how much hellrock is mined, it appears that they will never run out of the magical substance.

Hellrock duergar society is fragmented. Though ostensibly a large clan of duergar, centuries of life has seen the clan split into several houses, or gressen. The powerful gressen determine overall direction and goals of the clan, while lesser gressen scheme constantly to acquire power and become larger. Each gressen is run by a matron who is turn backed by an infernal power, usually a devil, but for the most powerful gressen, the support of a demi-god such as Asmodeus is not unheard of. To many people's surprise, other duergar and even dwarves are welcome to join - what is most important to those born of the Hellrock is growth and loyalty to one's gressen and the powers backing them. If a duergar or dwarf wishes to join their clan, and submit to arcane rituals to test their loyalty, they are welcome in. Most dwarves and many duergar are rightfully suspicious of those born of the Hellrock, so keep their distance. </specific>
    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Hellrock duergar lack quills or even the white hair of other duergar. Their skin is an even darker grey, and their eyes burn with intense reds and oranges. Hellrock duergar smile (on rare occasion) with razor-sharp teeth. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> Hellrock duergar, while still treacherous and cruel, are on the surface much more open-minded and less stubborn than their kin. Hellrock duergar, similar to the devils they consort with, seek to influence others to their ways of thinking and then corrupt them. It doesn't take long to discover their true purpose, but many have been lured in by the promises of what hellrock or the duergar's patrons can bring.

It is common for a child of the hellrock to explore the world on the surface. It is not because the hellrock duergar have any great love for the other races, but because they are always seeking some advantage over their rivals in oppossing gressen. Making allies on the surface, or finding some new magic or tool can be all the competitve edge that's needed to advance one's gressen, and therefore, one's position.

Hellrock duergar have inherited a natural curiosity from their explorations into the arcane. They are more prone than their kin to hear the words of others. They are inflexible to all matters regarding their own identity, however.

While they consort with devils, the hellrock duergar do not consider themselves evil. Though their patrons may wish to take over the world, the children of the Hellrock are more concerned with drawing forth more of their infernal roots, becoming more of who they feel that they are. To this end, they will go to any extreme. </specific>

Lore: Gamble rested on Jarn Blacktooth's hip through every thrill-seeking risk the bandit took. A notorious outlaw, Jarn never calculated when he could trust fate.  A chaotic life resulted.  Jarn experienced dizzying highs (he once bluffed a small army into surrender when he was outnumbered ten to one) and crushing setbacks (being tortured for four years in the king's dungeons). The bandit's fortunes rose for him but seemed to rise just as high for his foes.  Jarn died in a bar-room fight that began when he found someone cheating at cards.  Gamble changed owners and continues changing owners, resting on the table at gambling pits throughout the world.

Whispers: Gamble compels its wielder to stop calculating and to start taking more risks.  Seek thrills, embrace chaos, luck and fortune.

Release: Gamble can only change owners as a result of a wager in a game of chance.

Lore: Known throughout the land for his chivalry and bravery Lorry Korrum never one retreated from a confrontation. He stood at the front line of every battle to keep the young king Frey Halmond enthroned. But one man cannot be an army.  The boy-king was loved by the people but did not have the force of arms to deny his challengers.  Soon his enemies stood at his gates.  A defender to the end, Lorry chose to stand and fight the besieging forces.

Opportunities to see Frey to safety presented themselves, but Lorry would never retreat from a righteous battle.  Lorry fought valiantly, but in choosing to fight he failed his king.  The usurpers killed Lorry.   They tortured  Frey and put him to the sword days later.  Lorry realized in his dying moments the error of his pride. His need for glory and valor doomed the king and the realm.  The only remains of the knight's chivalry is his sword, wielded in battle by a hundreds of doomed protectors.  Each warrior's name is magically etched into the blade upon his death.

Whispers: Valor compels its wielder to fight for justice always.  All wrongs can be righted with a blade.  All battles worth fighting are fought with mighty and just sword arm.  Only cowards retreat.  The innocent must be protected at all costs.

Release: The wielder must protect a noble lord against a siege. When released, Valor becomes +2 Defensive weapon.

	  Lore: The king Hornestus Leopold thought himself surrounded by enemies. Self-titled Hornestus the Bold, the king confronted these "enemies", finding them in whatever stones they hid under.  Hornestus' subjects (when they were not being observed) knew the king as "Hornestus the Headless", as he made it clearly known that he would rule an entire kingdom of headless subjects to be free of enemies and conspirators at last.

From the beginning to the end of each day, executioners plied their axes, fulfilling the kings rising quotas for conspirator blood. Their bodies could not keep pace with the demands.  Even Hornestus found himself fatigued.  The executions had become... tiresome.  This worried him even more.  If he could not be eternally vigilant, his enemies would find a way into the throne room with daggers in hand.  How to alleviate that boredom growing in his heart?

Sedello!  The jester languished in the king's dungeons.  Hornestus kept the fool waiting a full ten years for a jest made at the king's expense.  Hornestus had failed all this time to devise a suitable end for Sedello, but the fool would now serve higher aims. Darkly inspired, the king thought to laugh his way through the ennui of his daily executions.

The king's guards dragged the fool into the light for his new work. The fool was dressed in the same jester's outfit the king imprisoned him in.  These ten long years Sedello remained in good spirits. Surely, the king took some mild offense and needed to find the appropriate moment to apologize and entertain Hornestus.   Once Hornestus let the performer revise his routine (with a noticeable absence of comments regarding the king himself) all would be forgiven and returned as it once was. Sedello began his routine and his wit shone, creating the only bright spot in the gallows.  Men waiting to executed even found their humor at the last.

Hornestus kicked the executioner's axe towards the fool.  "Alright fool, get to work.  Behead that man or back to your cell to rot forever."

The fool begged the king to spare him this grisly duty, but Hornestus would not be turned. Afraid to face ten more years in a lightless cell by himself, Sedello clumsily hoisted the axe. His weak frame proved unsuitable for the task.  He fumbled the strikes, slipping and tumbling in the bloody mess he created.  Ten minutes later the piteous beheading was done; Hornestus erupted into deep belly laughter at the spectacle.

"You'll see the cell again, fool.  You'll come when called and entertain me.  Behead my enemies after the joke is made and then go back to your cell.  You'll continue in this way until you die or I grow bored."  Sedello stood, eyes fixated on nothing. He was covered in blood, leaning exhaustedly on an axe larger than he.  The king's guards dragged the fool back to his cell.

Rather than wither, the man who became known as the Red Clown grew. Each time the Red Clown was called from the cell, his hands steadied; his frame soon fleshed itself out with muscle for its tasks.  He could now cut a man as easily with an axe as he could with wit; he cut men with both daily.  With a joke, a smile, and a quick chop of the axe, the Red Clown became the icon of Hornestus' bloody rule.

One day the Red Clown's smile vanished.  That day the king and everyone in his keep lost their heads.  His last performance completed, the clown threw his axe in the river.  He was never seen again.

His axe has been seen many places over the years, in the hands of men mad with slaughter, cackling and laughing as they stomp through fields of blood and gore.

Whispers: "Your life is the darkest of jokes!  Laugh, you dimwit.  Smile.  Take the axe and make a thousand smiles just like yours!  If things are too serious, lighten the mood!"

Release: Either behead a king or tell a joke to a creature from the Shadowfell and get it to laugh.

Lore: Spiral draws you in. At rest the whip is its namesake, naturally coiling into its mesmeric pattern. Woven with braids of banshee hair, Spiral's pull is to a place not fully known or readily grasped.  Regardless of its origins, the whip draws its wielder into a narrow, more insular perspective. 

Given time, Spiral's wielder can draw those whorls to mind, and drawing those to mind can manifest them into the physical world.  The spirals appear as spinning gales or hypnotic patterns floating in space.

You begin to see spirals everywhere and at a glance, for a spiral is one of the multiverse's true shapes.  But it is a shape that beckons introspective madness.  It draws you in.  You become connected and yet more vulnerable to the world.  It takes more and more concentration to remember what you were before you started spinning. Eventually you stop concentrating and start spinning.

You end up inside.  Of what, it cannot be told.

Whispers: Trust only yourself; move your mind towards the entropic whorls you can now see, the banshees sing.

The staged curse: A staged curse has multiple curse levels, each level corresponding to an additional power or property.  Wielding Spiral provides the wielder with the initial curse and power or property.  To gain the additional properties, the wielder must take the associated curse.  Once the curse is taken, it cannot be foregone until the player rids itself of the weapon.

Release: You must come back from 'The Inside'
