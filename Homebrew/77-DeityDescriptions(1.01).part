The god of change, Avandra delights in freedom, trade, travel, adventure, and the frontier. Her temples are few in civilized lands, but her wayside shrines appear throughout the world. Halflings, merchants, and all types of adventurers are drawn to her worship, and many people raise a glass in her honor, viewing her as the god of luck. Her commandments are few: 
* Luck favors the bold. Take your fate into your own hands, and Avandra smiles upon you.
* Strike back against those who would rob you of your freedom and urge others to fight for their own liberty.
* Change is inevitable, but it takes the work of the faithful to ensure that change is for the better.

Artists and musicians worship him, as do those who view their spellcasting as an art, and his shrines can be found throughout the Feywild.

* Cultivate beauty in all that you do, whether you're casting a spell, composing a saga, strumming a lute, or practicing the arts of war.
* Seek out lost magic items, forgotten rituals, and ancient works of art. Corellon might have inspired them in the world's first days.
* Thwart the followers of Lolth at every opportunity.

* Seek the perfection of your mind by bringing reason, perception, and emotion into balance with one another. 
* Accumulate, preserve, and distribute knowledge in all forms. Pursue education, build libraries, and seek out lost and ancient lore.
* Be watchful at all times for the followers of Vecna, who seek to control knowledge and keep secrets. Oppose their schemes, unmask their secrets, and blind them with the light of truth and reason.

The name of the god of death is long forgotten, but she is called the Raven Queen. She is the spinner of fate and the patron of winter. She marks the end of each mortal life, and mourners call upon her during funeral rites, in the hope that she will guard the departed from the curse of undeath. She expects her followers to:
* Hold no pity for those who suffer and die, for death is the natural end of life.
* Bring down the proud who try to cast off the chains of fate. As the instrument of the Raven Queen, you must punish hubris where you find it.
* Watch for the cults of Orcus and stamp them out whenever they arise. The Demon Prince of the Undead seeks to claim the Raven Queen's throne.

Amaunator is the reincarnated deity of the sun, the timekeeper of the gods. Though some say he died, he actually transformed into Lathander, and was worshiped under that name for centuries before finally reclaiming both his name and his mission. He causes the sun to burn and sets its course across the sky, giving rise to the celestial clock by which all time is measured.
	All who benefit from the accurate keeping of clocks and calendars—such as farmers, merchants, and nomads who follow the seasons—revere Amaunator. He is also favored by those mortals who respect the law and find comfort in predictability.
	Amaunatori are rigid and traditional in the worship of their deity, and little variety exists between different sects. His priests, the sunlords, offer their services as judges and administrators. Their most solemn observances are reserved for the day of the summer solstice.

Asmodeus is the evil god of tyranny and domination.He rules the Nine Hells with an iron fist and a silver tongue. Aside from devils, evil creatures such as rakshasas pay him homage, and evil tieflings and warlocks are drawn to his dark cults. His rules are strict and his punishments harsh:
•	Seek power over others, that you might rule with strength as the Lord of Hell does.
•	Repay evil with evil. If others are kind to you, exploit their weakness for your own gain.
•	Show neither pity nor mercy to those who are caught underfoot as you climb your way to power. The weak do not deserve compassion.

Chauntea is among the oldest of the deities, having been present at the creation of Abeir-Toril, infusing the twin worlds with the essence of life. She holds sway not so much over the natural world, but over the way in which sentient mortals interact with the world.
	The Great Mother is revered by any who depend on the land for their livelihood. A kindly mistress, she ensures healthy harvests to those who treat the tilled earth with the respect she demands.
	Chauntean priests pray to the Great Mother at sunset. For her favor, she asks that her faithful spend every effort preserving the natural cycle of growth and harvest. The devoted are divided into two sects: the pastorals, who minister to farmers and villagers, and the true shapers, solitary druids who find truth in the wild lands yet to be tamed.

The mad god of strife and lies, Cyric is chaos incarnate. He is reviled by his fellow deities, who have time and again intervened to stop his destructive flights of fancy. When he murdered Mystra in the Year of Blue Fire (1385 DR), the entire plane of Dweomerheart exploded, and the resulting Spellplague ravaged the cosmos. Tyr, Lathander, and Sune united to imprison him in his nightmarish playhouse of a plane, the Supreme Throne, where he remains to this day, alone and increasingly insane.
	Cyricists, inspired by the lunatic clergy who call themselves strifeleaders, spread chaos, destruction, and insanity wherever they go. Few can understand what vile disease of the mind could bring a mortal to serve such a deity in the first place, but where his worship takes hold, only misery follows. His wild rantings are inscribed in The Cyrinishad, a tome of ever-changing text that drives any who read it hopelessly mad.

Ghaunadaur was once worshiped by drow and coexisted with Lolth when the Abyss held the Demonweb Pits. Not long after the Spider Queen transformed into a greater god, she arranged for Ghaunadaur's drow followers to forget him.
	That Which Lurks, having watched the rest of the drow deities die in their struggle against Lolth, knew enough to slink away into the darkest corner of the cosmos he could find. In the Dismal Caverns, Ghaunadaur's power grew. He has come to rule the lowest forms of sentience: the oozes, slimes, and abominations.
	Ghaunadaur revels in the suffering of all forms of life, and in the feel of flesh consumed by acid. He is revered by incredibly ancient creatures, including the terrifying abominations of the Abolethic Sovereignty. His priests are unbound by holy days or scripture, compelled only to destroy and consume in the name of their hateful master.

Kelemvor presides over the passage from life to death with a firm hand and a steady grace. He is deeply earnest in his role as the Judge of the Damned, having set himself above the push and pull of law and chaos, good and evil. He takes each soul as it comes, preaching only the natural inevitability of its transition from one world to the next.
	Because of Kelemvor's deep respect for both life and death, the undead enrage him. His priests are tireless opponents of the necromantic arts. Families who lose a loved one are comforted by Kelemvor's doomguides, who counsel the bereaved with a gentle understanding and a simple philosophy that with light there must be darkness, with day there must be night, with life there must be death.
	Shieldmeet and the Feast of the Moon are set aside as days of remembrance, when doomguides seek the counsel of the dead.

The deity of knowledge is the judge of ideas and innovations, deciding what will be passed down and what will be forgotten. This is a responsibility that Oghma takes seriously, despite his outwardly carefree demeanor.
	Oghma thrives on ideas. He cannot abide the stifling of an original thought, no matter what might come of it, good or ill. It is for him to decide if a concept is carried forward from its originator, and he is protective of that power.
	When Oghma's Chosen, Grand Patriarch Cullen Kordamant, disappeared more than 120 years ago, his faith was split between two major factions— Procampur's Orthodox Church of Oghma and the Oghmanyte Church in Exile, formerly of Sembia but now Cormyrian. Orthodox priests are known as lorekeepers; the Oghmanytes call themselves namers. Both maintain expansive libraries and greedily pursue written texts and oral histories from across Toril.

Together with her sister Shar, Selûne created Abeir-Toril from the cosmic ether and assisted Chauntea as she blessed the twin worlds with life. She has infused her spirit into the moon and forever looks down on the world she helped create.
	Selûne's influence on Toril is felt in the ebb and flow of the tides and in the comforting silver glow of a moonlit night. She brings light to darkness, holding back the tide of evil embodied by her shadowy sister.
	Mostly female, the Selûnite priests known as silverstars administer to their flocks with patience and compassion, letting all know that “anywhere the full moon shines is the place for Selûne.”
	Silverstars are particularly interested in combating the dark side of lycanthropy. They wander Toril in search of werecreatures, hoping to aid them in maintaining or regaining control, or destroying those who have allowed their humanity to be overwhelmed by their affliction

The balance to her sister's loving grace, Shar resides in the deepest shadows, nurturing the secret hatreds, the unnatural desires, and the lust for revenge that reside in the black corners of the mortal heart.
	Her worshipers wield great power over other mortals and have worked their way into the highest governing ranks of countless realms. In the Empire of Netheril, allegiance to Shar, and Shar alone, carries the weight of law.
	Her nightcloaks form their own cells from what scraps of secret lore they can find. Temples of Shar practice devotion to her in wildly varying ways. Often the presence of a temple is revealed only to a small inner circle of lay initiates who are tasked with spreading Shar's whispered dogma in their own way.

The protector of the wild places, Silvanus is often seen as the deity of angry and vengeful druids who value the life of a tree over the life of a person. In fact, Silvanus teaches his followers to value all life. Still, his influence can be properly interpreted either as a wholesome respect for the natural world, or as a threat to the livelihood of expanding civilizations.
	Druids of Silvanus say their prayers at sundown and set aside the days of Greengrass, Midsummer, and Highharvestide for meditation and communion with their deity and his affiliated powers. Seemingly at whim, Silvanus brings the natural world to sentient life, with streams finding their own courses and trees uprooting to walk around. This event, known as the Night the Forest Walks, can be localized or global in effect, entirely dependent on the unknowable desires of the Treefather.
	Silvanus teaches his druids to watch from the protection of the woods, not to judge too quickly, and to preserve the balance of life and death, growth and decay.

The deity of love takes many forms, including that of Hanali Celanil, long worshiped as a goddess by the eladrin. She is the mistress of all that is beautiful and thrives on the most tender of emotions. Many deities, from Amaunator to Torm, have become smitten with the goddess of love, but she remains aloof (though flirtatious), reserving her love for the mortals who revere her name.
	The worship of Sune is prevalent in cities and among the aristocracy, where people have the time to give proper attention to values such as romantic love and the preservation of beauty.
	Numbering eight females for every male, Sune's heartwarders are among the most beautiful humans, eladrin, and half-elves on Toril. Their informal hierarchy is loosely controlled by the most charismatic of the local priests.

The Lord of Warrior's Rest favors both sides in any conflict with equal measure as long as both are sworn to victory. He is the patron of warriors of all stripes—from the lowliest man-at-arms to the mightiest commander. For Tempus, war is a force of nature that must be respected for its power to remake civilizations.
	Hardly a soldier on the face of Toril fails to lift his or her voice in prayer to Tempus on the eve of battle. Given the war-ravaged history of the world, Tempus has gained extraordinary power from such constant and fervent prayer.
	His battleguards counsel generals on the rules of engagement and inspire courage in combatants by blessing their weapons in the name of Tempus. The Tempuran faith is scattered throughout the world, wherever arms are taken up, and his priests come from all walks of life, from the soldiery of the civilized nations to the savage tribes of the frozen North.

Torm became the master of Celestia after the heroic self-sacrifice of the legendary Tyr (who perished decades ago when defending the upper realms against an overwhelming demonic incursion). He now shines as the beacon of pure law in the cosmos, and stands as the most civilized and civilizing force in the pantheon. Truth, loyalty, and a steadfast devotion to a righteous cause are his gifts to his mortal followers, and he is an inspiration to many of his fellow deities as well.
	The Tormish church includes the greatest number of paladins of any religious organization in the world, and his priests, known as holy champions, are accomplished warriors, ready to defend the principles of law and order.
	His temples take the form of mighty citadels, their imposing architecture a symbol of Torm's earnest stability in the face of chaos. From these edifices, Tormish priests and paladins are sent out into the world to root out corruption in any form, often imposing their own sets of laws and procedures on nations they feel are too open to lawlessness.
	The faithful celebrate two important holy days. The Divine Death (13 Marpenoth) commemorates the day when Torm and Bane destroyed each other during the Time of Troubles; the True Resurrection two days later honors Torm's return to life, while Bane (at least temporarily) still lay dead.

Angharradh, also referred to as the Queen of Arvandor, who was sometimes considered the personification of three separate elven goddesses, Aerdrie Faenya, Hanali Celanil, and Sehanine Moonbow, as well as a single goddess who extends beyond these three separate aspects before the Spellplague, is the chief goddess of the Seldarine. As such, her nature reflects traits of each of these deities. Due to the nature of her creation, Angharradh exhibits a fierce protectiveness and strong resolve. Despite her vigilance, the reversal of the Elven Retreat and the return of drow to Cormanthor have weakened Angharradh's spirit while causing the three goddesses to spend more time apart.

Berronar is Moradin's bride and as such the matriarch of the dwarven pantheon. The Revered Mother acts as an authority figure for the other dwarven gods and she uses her skills in negotiation and her calm demeanor as a way to keep the pantheon unified when tensions rise. Traditionalists of dwarven culture claim that without these qualities, the Morndinsamman and perhaps even the entire dwarven race would not have survived their slow decline. This decline finally seems to have reversed with the coming of the Thunder Blessing in the last century. In this new age the Revered Mother gives council to Faerûn's most trusted orthodox dwarven clerics as a way to aid Moradin in charting the dwarven destiny. Regardless of these recent events, the number of dwarves to turn their back on Berronar and Moradin has been steadily growing, since they believe the couple leads a too conservative philosophy.

• 	Hoard wealth, acquiring much and spending little. Wealth is its own reward.
• 	Forgive no slight and leave no wrong unpunished.
• 	Take what you desire from others. Those who lack the strength to defend their possessions are not worthy to own them.

The Queen of the Deeps is a harsh mistress, largely uncaring of her mortal worshipers' pleas for mercy when one of her storms whips the seas of Toril into a killing frenzy. Still, hardly a soul steps aboard a ship who doesn't whisper at least a cursory appeal to her in the hope that her random mercies fall their way.
Her waveservants rely on the scattered alms of terrified sailors for a minimal living, preaching the majesty of the uncaring ocean and the inherent hopelessness of anyone who dares set to sea.

Bahgtru is a rather stupid god (mentally), of pure physical strength. He scorns both weapons and magic alike. Bahgtru is the son of Gruumsh.
Bahgtru's followers are often the strongest of the orc tribes, and required to be unwaveringly loyal to their chieftain - until he is defeated in a challenge of physical strength or is slain. Among Bahgtru's faithful, loyalty only extends to the clan, rivalries between clans are encouraged.
Bahgtru serves Gruumsh loyally, and is feared by the other orc gods for his strength. He opposes the goblinoid deities, the Seldarine and sylvan deities. He respects the Dwarven gods for their strength, but would still like to crush their skulls. Bahgtru also hates the deities of deception; Baravar Cloakshadow, Cyric, and Mask.

Jergal (pronounced JER-gull), also referred to as The Lord of the End of Everything, is the seneschal of the Lord of the Dead who keeps records on the final disposition of all the spirits of the dead. Jergal is unfeeling and excessively formal, he never angers and always speaks in a disembodied, chilling voice. He cares little for anything besides an orderly accounting of the fate of the world as it slowly sinks into death, and he now serves Kelemvor as he previously served Cyric and Myrkul before him.
In ethos, Jergal is colder and more inhumane than his master, sanctioning the use and creation of undead by his followers, provided they serve the cause of advancing death in the world. He is not evil or malicious, but impassively records the death of all things.

Obould, known formerly as King Obould I Many-Arrows, is an exarch of Gruumsh and formerly the mortal king of the Broken Arrow tribe. Obould was a large orc who was intelligent even by human standards. Considering that the blessings bestowed upon him calmed him somewhat he had become able to see things in a far broader perspective than any orc before him. This led to a change in orcish society under his leadership and the founding of Many-Arrows. Obould was known to have four wives and at least eight sons. It was said his only fear was that when he dies his sons will destroy all he has created in their fight to succeed him.

Shiallia (pronounced shee-AL-yuh  or shee-AL-lee-ah) usually appears as a voluptuously beautiful female korred whose long blond hair is festooned with garlands of oak leaves and golden acorns. She is the patron and protector of pregnant forest creatures, a planter of trees and nurturer of seedlings. She rejoices in life and shields against death.  She is said to be earthy and winsome, and when not taking care of their needs delights in frolicking in the woods and playing with the woodland creatures who are her charges. At times she seems giddy and carefree, but has deeper qualities and a more mysterious quality which differentiates her from the fey forest creatures such as satyrs. While she is fiercely protective of those she protects, she is unlikely to interfere with matters outside of her portfolio if they do not directly involve her.

The current Siamorphe (pronounced SIGH-a-morf  or SEE-a-morf) usually appears as an older lady of the nobility, her hair touched with grey but well kept, and her iron-gray eyes missing nothing. Her clothing shows the jeweled purple of the true nobility, with a silver chalice and adamantine scepter in her hands, and a tiara carved from a single diamond on her brow.
Siamorphe is the vessel of a semi-divine power, which is passed down to a successor when the successor is dying. The current Siamorphe is the latest in that lineage. By preference, the successor is a direct descendant of the previous power’s mortal form, but anyone of noble blood will suffice. The former Siamorphe was a nobleman of Baldur's Gate, who passed the power to Lady Siamorphe of Waterdeep, chosen when she was killed in a riot in the Year of the Dusty Throne (1256 DR).
Her portfolio is providing the Divine Right of nobility to rule, and encouraging the responsibility to rule well and wisely for the more common classes beneath them. Her worship is most common among the nobility and their councilors, especially among those who seek reasons to explain why they are in charge.

Vergadain, also known as The Laughing Dwarf by non-dwarves, is the neutral dwarven deity of luck, trickery, negotiation and wealth and an exarch of Moradin. While it seems that Vergadain represents the dwarves' well-known dedication to the mercantile art of bargaining, those who know better are aware that he has an aspect that fills even the more legal-minded dwarves with pride. As such Vergadain also watches over those dwarves who use less-than-legal means to gain wealth. Regardless of how he is viewed, Vergadain delights in the art of the deal, no matter what it is, so long as it turns a profit.

Torog is the evil god of the Underdark, patron of jailers and torturers. Common superstition holds that if his name is spoken, the King that Crawls burrows up from below and drags the hapless speaker underground to an eternity of imprisonment and torture. Jailers and torturers pray to him in deep caves and cellars, and creatures of the Underdark revere him as well. He teaches his worshipers to:
•	Seek out and revere the deep places beneath the earth.
•	Delight in the giving of pain, and consider pain you receive as homage to Torog.
•	Bind tightly what is in your charge, and restrain those who wander free.

Tharizdun doesn't speak to his followers, so his commands are unknown, but his cults teach their members to:
• 	Channel power to the Chained God, so he can break his chains.
• 	Retrieve lost relics and shrines to the Chained God.
• 	Pursue the obliteration of the world, in anticipation of the Chained God's liberation.

Arawai is the goddess of fertility, abundance, and life (particularly plant life). She teaches that the wilderness holds great resources that empower civilization. The sister of Balinor and the Devourer, Arawai is also the mother of the Fury (as a result of her rape at the hands of the Devourer, according to Sovereign Host religious texts). She finds followers among parents, farmers, druids, rangers, sailors, and others who place great importance on nature, fertility, or the weather. Iconography usually depicts her as a halfelf female, sometimes as a human or a half ling, and occasionally as a bronze dragon.
Her tenets are simple and few:
- Be fruitful and multiply.
- Celebrate life, especially new life. A young sapling is a beautiful creation, and children are the world's greatest blessing.
- Never turn your back on a child or young creature in need.

Arawai is part of the The Sovereign Host, a group of deities collectively representing the entire world, but focusing on aspects of  civilization—community, the protection of the weak, the slaying of wild beasts, fertility, construction, and the like. The Sovereign Host is the most widely worshiped body in Khorvaire. Nearly everyone offers prayers to the Host as a whole and to individual deities for specific actions. For example, a farmer might whisper a prayer of thanks to Arawai when his baby is born healthy, and a blacksmith might sing the songs of Onatar when working at her forge. The  Sovereign Host finds worshipers among all races and from all walks of life—peasants, kings, and adventurers. The faithful worship the pantheon as a whole, rather than devoting themselves to specific deities. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals.

As a group, the Host exhorts its followers to:
-Place your trust in the community. The group is stronger by far than the individual. The great light of a city is composed of the thousands of flames of its citizens. You must ensure that your flame is as bright as you can make it.
- Treat others as they deserve to be treated. If they haven't harmed you or yours, treat them kindly.
- Bring the light of civilization to the darkness of the wilds.

Aureon is the god of knowledge, arcane lore, and magic. He also values order and law. He is Onatar's brother and Boldrei's husband, and bears a mysterious connection to the Shadow. Most arcane spellcasters call him their patron, as do sages, librarians, scribes, professors, and students. In religious texts, he appears as a human or gnome wizard, and, on rare occasion, as a grand blue dragon.
He urges his followers to:
- Respect and acquire knowledge, especially knowledge that was once lost. Knowledge is the most powerful force on Eberron.
- Value reason and sound thought over emotion and rash action.
- Educate yourself, your children, and your allies.

Balinor rules the beasts, the hunt, and the cycle of life. He teaches respect for wild animals and nature: One should take—carefully—only what one needs from the wild to improve civilization. That the intelligent races slay and eat animals is part of the natural cycle. That an occasional hunter falls to a rampaging boar or angry bear is also part of the cycle. Brother to both Arawai and the Devourer, Balinor counts rangers, druids, and hunters of all types among his followers. In images, he appears as a crude but good-natured human or half-orc, and sometimes as a green dragon.
His commands are straightforward:
- Take what you need from nature, but respect its power.
- Courage invites luck. Never flinch in the face of danger, but don't court it unprepared.
- Change is constant. The only certainty in life is death. Death is not to be feared, but celebrated as part of the natural cycle.

In some ways representative of the Sovereign Host as a whole, Boldrei's areas of influence are community and the safety and comfort of hearth and home. Her name is invoked at weddings and government appointments. She is Aureon's wife and counts commoners, parents, and militia members among her worshipers. She is usually depicted as a commoner of any race, and sometimes as a copper dragon brooding over a clutch of eggs.
Her tenets are:
- Value your community and family above yourself. Ensure that if you fall, they survive.
- Make your home your haven. Weighty and stressful affairs belong elsewhere, and violence in the home is unconscionable.
- Help other members of your community with no thought of recompense. Rewards come when they are needed.

Boldrei is part of the The Sovereign Host, a group of deities collectively representing the entire world, but focusing on aspects of  civilization—community, the protection of the weak, the slaying of wild beasts, fertility, construction, and the like. The Sovereign Host is the most widely worshiped body in Khorvaire. Nearly everyone offers prayers to the Host as a whole and to individual deities for specific actions. For example, a farmer might whisper a prayer of thanks to Arawai when his baby is born healthy, and a blacksmith might sing the songs of Onatar when working at her forge. The  Sovereign Host finds worshipers among all races and from all walks of life—peasants, kings, and adventurers. The faithful worship the pantheon as a whole, rather than devoting themselves to specific deities. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals.

As a group, the Host exhorts its followers to:
-Place your trust in the community. The group is stronger by far than the individual. The great light of a city is composed of the thousands of flames of its citizens. You must ensure that your flame is as bright as you can make it.
- Treat others as they deserve to be treated. If they haven't harmed you or yours, treat them kindly.
- Bring the light of civilization to the darkness of the wilds.

Dol Arrah is the shining goddess of honorable combat, selflessness, and sunlight. She brings light to pierce the dark places and blades to pierce the hearts of monsters. Legends say that Dol Dorn and the Mockery are her brothers. Paladins, warlords, and good-aligned fighters revere her, as do diplomats, who fight their battles with words instead of swords. She appears in religious texts as a human or half-elf knight alight with holy radiance, and sometimes as a red dragon atop a cloud.
Her teachings are:
- Bring succor to those who suffer.
- Bring the light of truth and goodness to dark and evil places.
- Bring force of arms against all that is evil.

The god of courage and physical prowess, Dol Dorn also exemplifies duty and war. He urges all people to be at their physical best. Soldiers, fighters, and warlords are his primary worshipers, along with athletes and acrobats. Said to be the brother of Dol Arrah and the Mockery, texts depict Dol Dorn as a musclebound human, dwarf, or half-orc, and occasionally as a mighty silver dragon.
His commands are simple but strong:
- Shirk your duty only if your charges have become unworthy of it.
- Achieve and maintain physical perfection.
- Test your physical powers in contests and in battle. May the strongest prevail!

Kol Korran's likeness appears on coins throughout the Five Nations, for he is the god of commerce and wealth. In the postwar world, where trade is cautiously emerging and expanding, his following is on the rise. Merchants, traders, and thieves are his primary Vassals, but anyone who has money, or wants more, pays him homage. Religious texts say he and his twin brother the Keeper are the sons of Olladra and Onatar. These same books depict him as a plump, cheerful human or dwarf in fine clothes. A few ancient depictions show him as a white dragon atop a bed of ice-blue gemstones.
He teaches his worshipers to:
- Acquire wealth.
- Travel. New lands offer new trading partners to cultivate and new resources to gather.
- Remember that a charming smile and a kind word are often more powerful than a blade and a strong arm.

The goddess of luck and plenty, Olladra's name is a popular one. People toast her at parties and festivals. Gamblers, rogues, bards, and hedonists pay her homage throughout the year. She is Onatar's wife and mother to the twins Kol Korran and the Keeper. In imagery, she is a young half ling, an old female human, and occasionally a black dragon.
Her tenets are:
- Eat, drink, and be merry, for life is good and luck comes to those who need it.
- Olladra favors the bold. Fashion your own destiny to enjoy her favor.
- Fight against oppression. Any who would deny you your freedoms should feel Olladra's anger.

Onatar is the god of forge and fire, of industry and craft. His name is invoked in factories and smithies, and his symbol appears on forges throughout Khorvaire. Dwarves in particular revere him, as do those who specialize in fiery magic—wizards and warlocks of the appropriate bent. Religious texts say he is husband to Olladra and father to Kol Korran and the Keeper. In these same sources, he appears commonly as a dwarf and occasionally as a brass dragon.
His commands are:
- Create. To craft an object or forge a weapon is to create a tool that many workers can use.
- Work. Work gives meaning to life and strength to communities.
- Respect fire. It is an invaluable tool and a powerful weapon.

The great trickster, the Traveler is a deity of cunning, deception, and change. The Traveler is a consummate shapechanger and master of disguises, and thus the being's true nature is unknown—texts variously refer to the Traveler as “it” rather than “he” or “she.” Many doppelgangers, shifters, lycanthropes, thieves, and rogues revere the Traveler, as do a few artificers who focus on the deity's innovation and cleverness. The Traveler is sometimes called the Giver of Gifts, but proverbs warn that one must be wary of its gifts. Ostensibly a member of the Dark Six, the Traveler seems to have no connection, familial or otherwise, to its fellows.
The Traveler's commandments must often be inferred, for its holy texts are few. Its tenets are:
- Revealing your true self is weakness. Shroud yourself in misdirection and disguise so that even you do not know what dwells in your core.
- Nothing is permanent. Ensure that change improves your lot and damages your enemies.
- The best weapons are cunning plans and intricate deceptions. Mortal minds are predictable and easily manipulated.

The Traveler is part of The Dark Six. Complementing the Sovereign Host and its focus on the light of civilization, the Dark Six represent the darkness of the wilds. The two pantheons were once combined, but a great schism separated them. The Dark Six now oppose the Host on all fronts. Where the Sovereign Host is generally good, the Dark Six are by and large evil. Where the Sovereign Host values community and government, the Dark Six value individuality and anarchy. The Dark Six are cruel, passionate, brutal, and wild.

The Mockery is the god of treachery and brutality. Evil assassins and fighters are among those who revere him.

The Mockery is part of The Dark Six. Complementing the Sovereign Host and its focus on the light of civilization, the Dark Six represent the darkness of the wilds. The two pantheons were once combined, but a great schism separated them. The Dark Six now oppose the Host on all fronts. Where the Sovereign Host is generally good, the Dark Six are by and large evil. Where the Sovereign Host values community and government, the Dark Six value individuality and anarchy. The Dark Six are cruel, passionate, brutal, and wild.

The Sovereign Host is a group of deities collectively representing the entire world, but focusing on aspects of  civilization—community, the protection of the weak, the slaying of wild beasts, fertility, construction, and the like. The Sovereign Host is the most widely worshiped body in Khorvaire. Nearly everyone offers prayers to the Host as a whole and to individual deities for specific actions. For example, a farmer might whisper a prayer of thanks to Arawai when his baby is born healthy, and a blacksmith might sing the songs of Onatar when working at her forge. The  Sovereign Host finds worshipers among all races and from all walks of life—peasants, kings, and adventurers. The faithful worship the pantheon as a whole, rather than devoting themselves to specific deities. Worshipers of the Sovereign Host are called Vassals.

As a group, the Host exhorts its followers to:
-Place your trust in the community. The group is stronger by far than the individual. The great light of a city is composed of the thousands of flames of its citizens. You must ensure that your flame is as bright as you can make it.
- Treat others as they deserve to be treated. If they haven't harmed you or yours, treat them kindly.
- Bring the light of civilization to the darkness of the wilds.

Second only to the Sovereign Host in popularity and prominence, the Silver Flame espouses purity, steadfastness, charity, and, above all, the destruction of evil. As such, paladins are its most fervent worshipers, but crusaders from all walks of life look to the Flame for guidance. The Silver Flame is an abstraction, not a deity. It represents powerful forces of good and self-sacrifice that keep evil locked away. In ages long past, a female human named Tira Miron transcended her humanity to become the immortal Voice of the Flame. She serves as the intermediary between the sacred Flame and the vast majority of mortals who haven't attained the purity necessary to communicate directly with the divine force.
The Church of the Silver Flame is much more organized than the hierarchy of the Sovereign Host. The Church has a definite chain of command, and its members aren't afraid to wield their power in secularaffairs. Flamekeep, in Thrane, is the Church's capital and home to its leader, the Keeper of the Flame. The teachings of the Silver Flame (and its church) are:
- Destroy evil in all its forms. Undead are particularly abhorrent to the Silver Flame.
- Bring relief to those who suffer.
- Protect those who cannot protect themselves.Offer aid to those who can.

The faithful of the Blood of Vol are captivated by the literal and figurative meaning of blood and of heredity, seeing blood  as a source of power and divinity. They focus their energy on self-improvement, shunning higher forces. Worshipers believe in the power of what is physical and present, and focus on the affairs of day-to-day life, not on an illusory  otherworldly power. Blood is the divinity within, the source of life, and, if one's faith is strong and one's abilities mastered, the only true path to immortality. Adherents of the Blood of Vol are often distrusted by members of other faiths because of rumors that the Blood of Vol worships the undead. Widely misunderstood, the teachings of the religion are dark and driven, but not evil. The same can be said of its followers.
The Blood of Vol's exhortations are simple:
- Believe in yourself. A common recitation when faced with a challenge or event: “As the blood is the power, and the blood flows through me, the power is mine.”
- Work to improve yourself and your capacities. A complete understanding of the divinity within opens the door to immortality.
- Meet with other members of the Blood of Vol to share in the power of each other's blood.

Rare in Khorvaire but prevalent among Adar's kalashtar, the Path of Light is equal parts philosophy and religion. Its adherents don't worship a deity, but instead recognize a universal force of positive energy they call il-Yannah, “the Great Light.” Followers of the Path of Light strive for physical and mental perfection through meditation and communion with this Great Light. Such perfection is necessary, for followers of the Path of Light expect to do battle with evil forces—especially the sinister Dreaming Dark.

The central teachings of the Path of Light are:
- Seek excellence in both mind and body, for a great war against the dark is brewing.
- Do not look to deities for divinity. Divinity is within the grasp of mortals if they but touch the Great Light.
- Use your honed skills to discover and vanquish evil beings.

Many elves of Aerenal, in particular the Valenar, revere their ancestors. This practice stops short of worship, but the spirits of the past represent glorious deeds and the rich history of the elven race. Even elves who follow other religions often maintain shrines to great ancestors. Elves who venerate the Spirits of the Past devote themselves to emulating patron spirits. Such elves have a martial bent—they are often rangers, fighters, or warlords. Particularly devout warriors sometimes attain the title Keeper of the Past; they are often bards or clerics. Although each practitioner honors an ancestor in his or her own way, followers of the Spirits of the Past share some common principles:
- Remember the great deeds and people of the past, and try to emulate and even to surpass them.
- Look to history and tradition for strength.
- Nothing is true today that wasn't true in the past; it just wears different trappings.

Some Aereni elves revere dead ancestors, and some revere ancestors who have eluded death's grasp. Long ago, the elves of Aerenal discovered the secret of extending their life spans. Only the wisest members of their race received this treatment, and these deathless creatures rule the elven homeland just as they did millennia ago. The Undying Court counts all Aereni elves as its followers, as well as Valenar and Khorvairian elves and half-elves. Its priests are clerics who dress in white and black; they wear death masks or paint or tattoo their faces with stylized skull images.

The Court's commands are ancient:
- Obey the commands of the Undying Court and its seneschals.
- Immortality is within reach if you prove yourself worthy of the gift.
- This world is but one stop on the soul's journey toward perfection, and death is merely a passage.

An ancient deity turned archdevil, the Lord of Nessus longed for untold millennia to reclaim his godhood. The destruction of Dweomerheart sent the dying Azuth (a patron deity of mages) into Asmodeus's fiery domain. The archdevil killed him and consumed his divine essence. He then ended the Blood War by pushing the Abyss to the bottom of the Elemental Chaos.
	Asmodeus is the unquestioned master of the Nine Hells, served by the eight archdevils, armies upon armies of lesser devils, and an ever-growing cadre of mortal worshipers.
	Priests who serve Asmodeus, known as the mordai, seek to pervert anyone who succumbs to greed and impatience. His sect observes no holy days; service is expected on a continuous basis.
	Asmodeus can be a charismatic and generous deity, quick to reward anyone who is willing to sign away his soul. After death, the damned are enslaved for eternity to their fiendish god's dark designs.

Thought to have been destroyed forever during the Time of Troubles, Bane returned to life in 1372 DR and continued his mission to dominate every mortal soul on Toril. The Black Lord of Banehold is the embodiment of tyranny.
	Bane's lust for power doesn't stop at the mystical walls that separate the world from the heartless gray hellscape of Banehold. Bane also seeks lordship over other deities, and he has killed and absorbed the essence and followers of numerous divine beings. He has drawn others into his command, including the goblin deities Maglubiyet and Hruggek and his consort, the twisted goddess Loviatar.
	Banite priests are expected to strive constantly for dominance over those around them. No holy days are observed in Bane's name, and the god scorns invocations that are not accompanied by proof of temporal power over others. When a mortal swears fealty to Bane, that service is absolute.

Gruumsh's influence has flourished in recent decades with the growth of the orc population, and as other humanoids have come under his sway.  Hisrecent triumphs include putting the orc pantheon and other minor deities of the savage races under his thumb.
	Though Gruumans maintain that their god was born with one eye, the eladrin assert that he lost an eye in combat with Corellon. The two divine powers have fought countless times, and they remain the bitterest of enemies.
	Gruumsh is a god of conquest, driving his savage multitudes to expand their power by whatever brutal means they wish. His shamans advise chiefs and warmongers to raid, kill, and conquer.
	The last day of Marpenoth, which Gruumans call Gharfek'taaz (“Feast of the Bloodied Stones”), commemorates Gruumsh's ascendancy as the master of Nishrek. On this day, new shamans are ordained in a bloody orgy of torture and sacrifice.

The Spider Queen sits alone in the Demonweb Pits, presiding over the drow and their manifold schemes and betrayals. She revels in blood, hungers for sacrifice, and toys with worshipers and victims alike. Hers is a cold cruelty born of the blackest pits in the endless Abyss.
	Lolth exists on her home plane in the form of seven monstrous spiders and one beautiful drow maiden. She took these forms when, through the force of her own horrific will, she transformed into the greater goddess she is today.
	Lolth appears to her worshipers from time to time, but never because she is summoned. Lolth serves no one, and she demands absolute fealty from all drow, though only females can serve her as arachne. Males are considered unclean, if occasionally necessary. Still, if one turns his back on her, she takes vengeful notice.

Legends of the epic battles between Corellon (sometimes called Corellon Larethian) and Gruumsh are the most repeated in the history of Toril. During that great struggle, the eladrin were born of Corellon's blood. He is the benevolent ruler of Arvandor and the leader of the Seldarine (“the fellowship of brothers and sisters of the wood”), god and exarchs who embody the eladrin's proud and ancient traditions.
	Though he is a skilled warrior, it is his love of the eladrin and their great works of magic and beauty that inspires Corellon. That inspiration is returned to his people a thousandfold.
	Corellon's feywardens are charged with protecting the traditions and works of their race. They turn aside political power, acting as advisors to the kings and queens of the elven realms.
	The holiest day for Corellites is Shieldmeet, but every month they gather under the crescent moon to observe Lateu'quor, the Forest Communion of the Crescent Moon, praising their deity with a multitude of beautiful works.

Aurom was an early god—or, in some records, goddess—of the dead. Since he was a tribal god, he held sway over a broad spectrum of subjects. Many deities were less than pleased with Aurom's claim on so many subjects. Aurom was slain by Nerull, a powerful mortal necromancer seeking divinity. Nerull took only the portfolio of death from the dead deity and left Aurom's other portfolios to be divided among the other deities, thus securing a place among them.
	Aurom's existence was long hidden, since Nerull erased any knowledge of his predecessor that he could track down. Those who taught that Nerull had not always been the only god of the dead met horrible fates. The truth finally came to light when the Raven Queen slew Nerull and saw a benefit in weakening that god's original hold by revealing the truth of his origins.
	Little is known of Aurom despite the Raven Queen's revelations, and few people agree on what he or she was really like. Various sects have sprung up, each with radically different ideas. Most sects survived for only a short while. The only sect to have persisted for more than a few decades now is the Enclave of Dust. Most members are dry and bookish, dispassionate folk who see death as a necessity. They renounce the importance of the soul. Their particularly morose outlook means their cult has been small over the years, but also has kept them from becoming important enough to be a target for elimination.
	The Enclave of Dust today speculates that Aurom taught the following:
	• Everything is part of the cycle. We are born. We live. We die. Respect life, and know death to be a part of it.
	• We are created from the elements and return to the chaos when it ends. The primordials are our enemies. They seek to undo the cycle, refusing to be part of it.
	• Undeath is a punishment and trial. It should be ended for those who do not deserve it, and it should be prolonged or inflicted on those who do.
	• Do not fight death. Do not seek to be more than you are. We are all dust.

Haramathur was a guardian god who was tasked during the Dawn War with the protection of the Astral Sea against incursions of creatures from the Elemental Chaos. He had no enemies among the other deities, who recognized him as a force whose power protected them.
	In the last years of the Dawn War, Io's violent death caused a rift between the planes. Haramathur realized the only way to prevent the primordials from using the rift to invade the Astral Sea was to close off the way with his own essence. He sacrificed himself by turning himself and everything around him to stone to seal the rift. Few individuals know Haramathur's role in these events. The deities try to limit any knowledge of what happened because they fear that someone might seek to restore Haramathur to his original form, and hence restart the war.
	Haramathur's body exists in two different locations, with one in the Astral Plane and one in the Elemental Chaos. In the Astral Plane, his essence is interwoven with the realm now known as Erishani (described in The Plane Above). Here, Haramathur's remaining power holds in stasis an ancient primordial. Few are aware of his influence there, and other deities leave this realm alone. Only a few key people in the settlement of Rhym Katal know the truth.
	In the Elemental Chaos, Haramathur's stone body drifts in a calm area that exists in a twenty-mile wide maelstrom of rock, ash, and molten lava. The area is called Mael Arn'dreygh, or the Sealed Way. The stony form holds only one settlement: a fortresslike githzerai monastery hewn from the rock. The githzerai monks, who call themselves the Disciples of Stone, are rumored to communicate with stone, and they are led by Asaerte Nedanar, a powerful psion. Asaerte knows the full history of Haramathur and Mael Arn'dreygh, but he has not yet passed this knowledge along to a successor or allowed anyone into the monastery's inner sanctum. The monastery is also the only place that possesses written records of the event, which are chiseled in the stone walls of the inner sanctum.
	Some say that those who become lost in the maelstrom around Mael Arn'dreygh might end up in the bogs of Erishani, and vice versa. So far, none who have disappeared in the maelstrom have ever returned alive.
	When still alive, Haramathur taught the following:
	• Protect those for whom you care, as well as those who cannot protect themselves.
	• Patience is a virtue. Wait for your enemies to move. Stay ever vigilant.
	• Do not fear the darkness. Train yourself to be aware of your enemies with all your senses.
	• The earth is your friend. Use it to protect yourself and trap your enemies.

Laeris was the god of trickery and deceit—a playful god who was quick to draw the ire, if not open hostility, of his fellow deities by his frequent pranks and his lack of personal boundaries. Laeris's true form is unknown. He did not have a favorite avatar form, and instead he used various races of either gender—whatever suited him best at the time. His origins are shrouded in mystery, and so is his death.
	The story says that Vecna killed Laeris when the trickster attempted to steal the Final Moment, a powerful draught that can imbue the imbiber with a most profound insight into his own destiny. Laeris entered Citadel Cavitius, Vecna's stronghold, but Vecna destroyed Laeris in the same moment the trickster recovered and drank the Moment.
	Some say the story is fabricated. They believe Laeris fled with the Moment, and now lays low, fearing Vecna's wrath. Whether Laeris is truly dead or whether it is all a ruse is unknown. His followers tell both tales—and various others—which only adds to the confusion. And, of course, Vecna never revealed what happened.
	As a result, cults to Laeris still exist, though priests are few and far between.
	When still alive (or, at least, active), Laeris taught the following:
	• Truth does not exist. Everybody lies. Don't trust anyone.
	• Law is a crutch. Only those who can do as they want are truly free.
	• Property is an illusion. Take what you need today, but do not hold on to it tomorrow.
	• Hide your activities from others. Lie about your motives. Never reveal your goals. Only those who can see through your deceits are worthy to discover your true goals.

Nusemnee was the daughter of Zehir and a powerful devil. A scaled, lean woman with burning eyes, her fangs dripped with poison. She was originally an assassin for her father, supporting his schemes by murdering his opponents. When she failed to assassinate a high priest of Pelor, she was abandoned and then mortally wounded by a paladin's holy blade. Expecting only death, she was surprised when the high priest healed her, showing her compassion and forgiveness. Intrigued, she decided to honor a promise to the high priest and aid him in his holy quest until a time that she could save his life in turn.
	Nusemnee thus became a symbol of redemption. When she finally died at the end of the high priest's quest, she rose again, this time as a minor goddess. In this form, she opposed her father by offering redemption to all who would turn away from evil.
	Nusemnee was later killed by a poison that could kill anything—even a deity—that was distilled from Zehir's blood. Her body, a scaly withered husk, drifts in one of the darkest portions of the Astral Sea, where it is sought out by redemption seekers. Some say that Nusemnee's blood still holds a poison strong enough to kill even Zehir. Vicious devils and a force of yuan-ti abominations guard the body in Zehir's name. So far, nobody has drawn a single drop of blood from her dehydrated corpse.
	Since Nusemnee died relatively recently, a number of cults and priests still exist today. Their numbers dwindle as people turn their worship to other deities. Temples to Nusemnee exist in twilight places, city slums, and the upper Underdark, where those most in need of redemption can be found.
	When still alive, Nusemnee taught the following:
	• It is never too late to seek redemption.
	• True heroism does not come from good deeds. It comes from doing good when it matters.
	• Nobody is perfect. Those who seek to be perfect will fail. It is not a shame to fail, and it is not a waste to try.
	• Open your heart to possibilities. Never give up hope.

Sagawehn was the goddess of insects. Where other deities relied on the prayers of intelligent beings, the Winged Mistress took her power from creatures that did not have individual thoughts. All insects, no matter how mindless or seemingly insignificant, belonged to her. Although a single individual from the intelligent races offered more power than a lonely insect, Sagawehn's flock came in much larger numbers.
	Sagawehn was a passionless deity who valued the community—the hive—above all else. She sought to crush individuality, perceiving it as a danger to the whole. She aimed to expand always; those she met either joined the hive or were crushed by it. Understandably, she was never popular among humankind, though some thri-kreen tribes paid her homage.
	Sagawehn originally resided in Arvandor, but her expansionism soon came into conflict with other beings on that plane, especially the fey that worshiped Corellon. Faced with either assimilation or war, the fey, backed with powerful divine magic, attempted to stop Sagawehn and drive her back.
	After a long war, several powerful eladrin heroes sought out Sagawehn to either stop the invasion or slay her. She appeared as a mass of beetles, spiders, and other vermin. In an epic battle Sagawehn was slain—but not before many eladrin fell, among them the priestess whose last magic spell took Sagawehn's life.
	No astral corpse remains of Sagawehn. Some say she is not truly dead, but that her legacy continues on in the lamia that spawned from the high priestess who fell to the vermin that devoured her.
	The priests in Sagawehn's cults are called hive masters. Each has a fascination for vermin. Insect colonies form the model for a life that is much more structured than that of most other races. They either teach such order and community feeling to their people—or force it upon them.
	When still alive, Sagawehn taught the following:
	• The community is the greater good. Sacrifice all for the whole.
	• A community thrives if those within it do their jobs well—specialize and allow others to benefit.
	• Strength is in numbers. Power comes with growth and expansion.
	• Seek to expand. Conquer those who oppose you.

Sehanine Moonbow (pronounced seh-ha-neen moon-boe) is the fey aspect of Selûne, goddess of the moon. She is one of the more powerful members of the Seldarine. The Lady of Dreams actively opposes the nefarious schemes of the Spider Queen and the other drow powers. She is said to be the wife of Corellon Larethian. Sehanine lives in the realm of Arvandor.
As befits the elven goddess of mysteries, Sehanine is cloaked in secrets and illusions and rarely speaks her mind directly, preferring to communicate through a process of dreams, visions, and other mystic experiences. The Goddess of Moonlight is truly spiritual and ephemeral being who evades any attempt to define her and whose serenity surrounds her like a mantle of moondust.
