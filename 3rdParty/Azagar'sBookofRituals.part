You tap into the darker aspects of the arcane arts and cause one disease your target is currently suffering from to progress. When you perform this ritual, choose one specific target. The subject must already have contracted the disease. The subject must be someone you have seen either in person or through scrying magic. The subject must be on the same plane, but can be any distance away from you. Once the ritual is complete, the subject immediately makes an Endurance check against the targeted disease. 

Your Arcana check determines how much the subject's condition worsens.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Effect On Target
19 or lower	-5 to Endurance check. On a failed check the disease progresses.
20-29	-10 to Endurance check. On a failed check the disease progresses.
30-39	No save. Disease progresses.
40 or higher	No save. Disease immediately progresses to final state.&lt;/table&gt;

You target a non-hostile Tiny animal, such as a mouse or sparrow. The animal must remain within 5 squares of you for the time necessary to perform the ritual. Once the ritual is complete you transfer your consciousness into that of the animal and the animal's consciousness is temporarily displaced. Once your consciousness enters the animal's body, you gain all its senses (such as low-light vision) and control of its body as if it were your own. At the same time, your original body falls into a deep stasis.

A typical Tiny animal has 1 hit point, defenses equal to 10 + half your level, and no attacks. While your mental statistics do not change in animal form and you continue to understand all languages you know, you cannot speak or use any of your powers in animal form. Taking on animal form does not let you understand the speech of other animals of the same type.

You can return to your own body as a minor action as long as it is within a number of miles of your current location equal to your level. If the animal you are currently inhabiting is slain you must make a saving throw or lose one-quarter of your hit points from the shock of the experience as you return to your own body. If your original body is slain, you remain trapped in animal form until the ritual's duration ends, whereupon you die. If you return to your own body while the animal is still alive, it regains control of its body. 

The length of time you can stay in animal form depends on the results of your nature check.

By using one of your channel divinity powers (for example, divine fortune or lay on hands), you cause a single suit of armor to become invested with spiritual energy, causing it to glow with golden light or become wreathed in ethereal mist. The ritual provides the suit or armor with a single enchantment based on your level. You must remain in contact with the armor during the entire time it takes to perform the ritual. In addition, you cannot use the channel divinity power used to enhance the armor for the duration of the ritual. 

You may choose which power the armor possesses when you cast the ritual and as you increase in levels, the number of choices increases.

This ritual forms a bond between a creature with the mount keyword and a rider with the Mounted Combat feat (this rider can be you or another creature). Both creatures involved in the ritual must be within 5 squares of each other during the entire process. Once the ritual is completed, a mystical link binds the two creatures together. 

While Bonded Mount is active, the rider ignores the normal penalty of 2 to attack rolls, AC, and Reflex when not using a saddle in combat, and can mount or dismount his mount as a minor action. Finally, once per encounter, the rider gains an extra move or standard action that he or his mount can use in addition to their normal set of actions. This allows the mount to make two move actions in the round, or the rider and mount to make one standard action (such as an attack) each during the round. These abilities can only be used if the rider is mounted on his bonded mount. 

The length of the bond is determined by the results of a Nature or Religion check. The bond can be broken if the rider or mount is slain or if they are more than 10 squares apart for more than 24 hours. You can extend the duration of the bond with another casting of the ritual, but it cannot be made permanent.

This powerful ritual calls a marut blademaster (see Dungeons and Dragons 4E Monster Manual) from the Astral Sea to serve you, completing a single task before  returning to its home plane. Once the marut blademaster appears, you must sign a contract provided by the creature and pay it 5,000 gp in gems. The marut then fulfils the contract to the best of its ability, and if successful returns  to claim the rest of its payment, another 5,000 gp in gems.
 
The task you command the marut to perform must be clearly defined, must be within its power to complete, and must last no longer than a year. Typical tasks include slaying a specific individual, guarding a particular spot, or providing information. If any of the conditions are breached, the contract is forfeited and the marut returns to the Astral Sea. If the marut fails in its task or is killed in pursuit of its duties, the contract is also voided. 

At 25th level you can call on a marut concordant to perform a task for you instead through the casting of the same ritual. In this case, however, the payment is 20,000 gp in gems.

This ritual creates a set of magical golden chains covered in arcane or religious runes that appear around the arms and legs of any creature called or summoned into a Magic Circle. The creature gains no defense against the chains, and cannot move or break free of the Magic Circle until the chains have been removed (see below).

When you create the chains, you make an Arcana or Religion check. This check is the break DC for the chains. The chains prevent the captured creature from moving in any way (including teleporting) or using any melee or ranged attacks against creatures outside the circle until the chains have been broken. 

The chains only last as long as the Magic Circle does, and any action which breaks the circle (such as an unaffected creature walking across the circle's boundary) also causes the chains to disappear. The chains are magical constructs, and are immune to all damage or breakage, except as specified above.

You create a zone that grants a bonus to attack rolls to certain divine powers. Affected powers must have the divine, implement, and radiant keywords to be affected by this ritual. In addition, only those that worship the same deity whose symbol is used in this ritual's focus can gain the bonus to attack rolls. The bonus only applies on attacks that both originate within the zone and target a creature within the zone. 

Your Religion check determines the bonus.

Any creature with the Channel Divinity feat that is a follower of the deity whose symbol is used in this ritual's focus can extend the duration of this ritual by expending a use of its Channel
Divinity power once every 24 hours. The creature sustaining the effect must be adjacent to the focus when sustaining the effect. If the effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the consecrated effect becomes permanent.

Focus: An obelisk, crypt, statue, or other structure bearing the image of a specific holy symbol. The focus must be carved from marble or other semi-precious stone valued at no less than
1,500 gold pieces. The effect is centered on the focus and ends immediately if the focus is moved, damaged, or destroyed.

You cast this ritual on the remains of a creature that has died within the past 30 days. It binds their spirit to the vicinity of its remains for a duration determined by your Arcana skill check, during which time the spirit lies dormant and does not attempt to travel to its final resting place. This period of time counts as additional time the spirit is still available to be rejoined with its physical form via the Raise Dead ritual. For example, an Arcana check result of 35 would indicate that a Raise Dead ritual could still be performed successfully up to 32 days after the creature's death.

You place a helpless or willing target (who must be present for the entire ritual) into a deep sleep. In this state, the target does not need to eat, drink, or breathe. The target appears dead, and only a Heal check with a DC equal to your Arcana or Religion check can tell that the creature is alive. The target is unaware of its surroundings and is unconscious and helpless.

When you complete this ritual, you must specify a trigger to awaken the target creature, often speaking a command word. The trigger must be general enough so that any creature that knows the trigger may perform it. The creature also awakens if it takes damage or if the duration expires, but otherwise the target is impossible to awaken.

You can extend the duration of Eternal Slumber by spending 1 healing surge every 24 hour to sustain it. If you sustain it a year and a day, the effect becomes permanent until discharged.

As part of this ritual, you draw up a contract that may describe any terms you desire. When the ritual is complete, any party who signs the contract is magical bound to agree to honor it. To be affected by the magic of this ritual, those signing the pact must do so of their own free will. If they are compelled, through either magic or mundane means, this ritual does not bind them. If any parties later break the contract, they instantly die.

If the offending creatures are later returned to life, they have one week to come back into compliance with the pact, otherwise they die again.

This ritual can only be cast on a helpless or willing creature. By casting the ritual and spending a healing surge, you place the creature under a magical compulsion to perform a service (or refrain from taking a certain course of action). The compulsion cannot force a creature to kill itself, but aside from that, there is no limit to what the creature can be compelled to do. The geased creature must follow the instructions as directed by the ritual caster, no matter how long they take. The geased creature is also incapable of causing harm to the caster of the ritual. As long as the creature is geased, the ritual caster must spend a healing surge every day to sustain the ritual.
Should the geased creature not comply with the compulsion, 24 hours later, the arcane energies of the ritual trigger a powerful magical disease that slowly saps the life-force from the victim, leaving him weak and drained, barely able to move. This magical disease is so powerful that the only way to be completely rid of it is to comply with the compulsion.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the geased creature cannot complete on its own, the geas disappears after a while. Your Arcana check determines how long it takes for the magical compulsion to fade.

You make a building, structure, or area sacred to a specific deity, creating a zone which allows worshipers to pay a reduced component cost when performing other rituals. You must be within the area or structure to be hallowed when you perform this ritual. If you are making an area hallowed, the zone is a burst 20 centered on a square occupied by the focus. If you are instead making a structure hallowed, the structure can be no larger than 20 squares by 20 squares and 50 feet (10 squares) in height. The hallowed zone extends 2 squares from the outer walls of the structure, regardless of the actual burst area of the effect.

If a ritual caster of a different religion attempts to perform a ritual within a hallowed zone, that ritual caster must double the component cost for the ritual. The caster learns of this as soon as he begins the ritual and can choose to end the ritual without expending any components.
In order to reduce the component cost of rituals cast within the hallowed area, you must have a holy symbol devoted to the proper deity and spend time in prayer. For every 3 hours you spend in prayer prior to performing the ritual you gain a 1% reduction in component cost, to a maximum of a 25% reduction. You can gain assistance in your prayers (up to four others). Anyone assisting in the prayers must also have a proper holy symbol and must participate in the following ritual. Persons assisting in prayer contribute only a 1% reduction per 6 hours of prayer.

During the prayer time, you can engage in light activity that doesn't require much exertion and you can take short rests; however, you cannot take an extended rest or sleep. If your prayer is interrupted, you can begin a ritual within 5 minutes with the discounted component cost; otherwise, you must begin your prayer again.

Any creature with the Channel Divinity feat who is a follower of the chosen deity can extend the duration of this ritual by expending a use of their Channel Divinity power within the hallowed zone once every 24 hours to sustain it. The creature sustaining the effect must be within the ritual's zone of effect. If the effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the hallowed effect becomes permanent.

Focus: A permanent altar, worth at least 5,000 gp, devoted to the chosen deity.

A more powerful form of Magic Circle, Improved Magic Circle requires 2 minutes to inscribe each square within the circle. When performing the ritual, you choose 2 origin categories (from aberrant, elemental, fey, immortal, natural, or shadow), or all. All applies a -5 penalty to your Arcana check.

An affected creature whose level is lower than your Arcana check -5 cannot pass through the circle, affect creatures through the circle's boundary, or affect the boundary in any way. On their first attempt to pass through the circle, other creatures of an affected origin take force damage equal to your Arcana check result. If they make a second attempt, they suffer the same damage; but doing so breaks the circle (only if the same creature made both attempts). Unaffected creatures can take a standard action to obscure the inscription and break the circle.

This ritual can only be cast on a creature already called or trapped within a Magic Circle. You must be within 5 squares of the creature for the entire casting of the ritual, and if the Magic Circle is broken during this time, the ritual fails. Once the ritual is cast, you forge a powerful mystical link between yourself and the trapped creature, forcing it to absorb any injury or effect inflicted on you. Using Lifeshield on an unwilling creature is an evil act.

While the ritual is in effect, any damage that you take a nd any effect or condition you suffer is redirected back to the creature. Therefore, you could be burnt by a red dragon's breath or stunned by a lamia's pacifying burst and the creature within the Magic Circle would take the fire damage and become stunned instead, leaving you completely unscathed. The source or keyword of the damage or effect does not change.

This ritual functions as long as you are on the same plane as the creature, and ends once the creature is killed or petrified, the Magic Circle is broken, or the duration ends. If the duration ends and the creature is still alive, it remains trapped within the Magic Circle. This ritual has no effect on any condition or affliction (such as a curse or disease) you were suffering from before casting the ritual.

To successfully perform this ritual you must make an Arcana check. If the Arcana check is less that the creature's level + 10, the ritual fails and the Magic Circle is broken, releasing the creature to its own devices. 

The Arcana check also determines the length of time that the ritual lasts.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Duration
29 or lower	1 hour
30-39	8 hours
40 or higher	1 day&lt;/table&gt;

This dangerous ritual forces a creature to perform a task for you or suffer debilitating pain or worse. The ritual only works on a creature called into a Magic Circle, and only affects a creature of your level or less. 

When you cast this ritual you must make an Arcana check against the Will defense of the creature. If this Arcana check fails, the creature is unaffected by the ritual and you suffer a magical backlash which deals an amount of damage equal to your failed check and the creature is freed from the Magic Circle. If you possess an object which is inimical or opposed to the creature in some way, you gain a +5 bonus to your Arcana check. If you have a part of the creature or an object possessed by it, you gain a +10 bonus to your Arcana check. These bonuses stack for the purpose of this ritual.
 
If the ritual is successful, the creature is mystically bound to you and must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. Any time the creature attacks you or otherwise fails to obey your commands, it immediately loses one healing surge and is stunned until the end of your next turn. If the creature loses all of its healing surges it takes 1d10 points of damage each time it disobeys you instead.

The ritual lasts for 24 hours or until the creature completes a specific task set before it. Therefore, the creature could be placed to guard a doorway for 24 hours or hunt down and slay a creature specified by you. Once the task is completed or the duration expires the creature is freed and is no longer under your control.

You can use this ritual in conjunction with some kind of treasure or reward to prevent the creature from turning against you once the ritual ends. What the creature does once the ritual's duration ends is up to your DM.

You alter the memories of a helpless or willing subject, so that it believes events transpired differently than they actually did. The target must be present for the entire ritual. The length of time you can modify the subject's memories depends on your Arcana check.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Duration
9 or lower	1 round
10-19	1 minute
20-29	1 hour
30-39	1 day
40 or higher	1 week&lt;/table&gt;

You may choose to modify memories from any point in the subject's life, but the time must be contiguous. You may change memories however you wish, but memories that do not fit with reality may cause the subject to realize that his memories are false. When the subject encounters such a contradiction, he makes an Insight check with a DC equal to your Arcana check to realize that his memory is faulty. The DM may assign a bonus or penalty to this check depending on how plausible the memory is.

This ritual places a distinct, glowing mark on one creature of your choosing, visible only to you and up to 5 chosen individuals. This mark remains for the duration of the ritual's effect, even if
the recipient changes shape, becomes invisible, or by some other method disguises himself. The mark gives off dim light equal to that of a candle.

On a check result of 40 or higher, the caster may renew the mark for an additional 7 days by spending a healing surge. This ritual is often used to keep track of thieves and murderers, or to discern the identity of a lycanthrope in human form.

Optional Focus: Up to 5 moonstones worth at least 100 gp each may be used instead of choosing individual persons. Each of these gems, when given to an individual, allows them to see the mark on the target.

You swear to safeguard someone important to you. This must be someone you know personally, but the person does not have to be present at the time of the oath. The person does have to be someone for whom you have strong protective feelings; you cannot swear this oath merely for convenience.

For the duration of the ritual, you always know in which general direction your ward is currently located. You can also sense the approximate distance separating you, but not necessarily the best way to cross that distance.

Any skill or stat check related to finding or protecting your ward is made with a +2 bonus, but any check that would endanger the ward or distract you from your guardianship suffers a -1 penalty. Checks which are unrelated to your oath are made normally.

When adjacent to the ward during combat, as a free action, you can choose to take a -2 penalty to all of your attacks, in return for a +2 bonus to all of your ward's defenses. You may also choose to spend a minor action and two healing surges in order to give your ward temporary hit points equal to his or her own healing surge value. When you spend an action point, rather than taking an extra action, you may instead allow your ward to take a minor or move action on your turn.

The effects of the ritual continue until you relinquish your ward, your ward rejects you, or your ward is killed. If your ward rejects you, you may choose to continue the effects of the ritual, but will no longer be able to sense the direction in which your ward is located or spend healing surges to give your ward temporary hit points.

If your ward is killed while under your protection or within 24 hours of being relinquished and you do not immediately move to avenge them, you take psychic damage equal to your healing surge value and suffer a -3 penalty to saving throws until you take an extended rest.

You may be under the effects of more than one Oath of the Guardian at one time. In this case, the penalties stack, while the bonuses do not. In a case where two oaths conflict, only the penalties apply.

Oath of the Guardian cannot be cast on an unwilling guardian. However, the ward is not necessarily aware of the oath, and must knowingly reject the guardian in order the end the oath's effects. Two individuals cannot be each other's guardians.

At the DM's discretion, you may be prohibited from declaring anyone of your own level or higher to be your ward.

This ritual binds a creature with the elemental origin within a non-living inanimate object, providing the object with a single resistance against an energy keyword to which the elemental creature is resistant. Therefore, you could bind a salamander lancer into a shield and make the shield resistant to fire or a thunderhawk into a staff and make the staff resistant to lightning or thunder. The elemental creature to be bound within the object must be within 5 squares of the object during the entire casting of the ritual and need not be willing for the ritual to take place (though in this case, it must be trapped in some fashion). The ritual works on magical objects, but only if the object's level is less than that of the elemental creature. The resistance imparted by this ritual applies only to the object, not its wielder (such as in the case of weapons, implements, and other items that use a character item slot).

Once the ritual is completed, the elemental creature merges with the object in question. The object also takes on a faint aura of a color appropriate to the keyword it is protected against.

&lt;table&gt;Keyword	Aura Color
Acid	Yellow
Cold	White
Fire	Red
Lightning	Blue
Thunder	Purple&lt;/table&gt;

The object gains resistance equal to half that of the creature bound within it against the keyword. If the creature is immune to the keyword, the object's resistance instead becomes 30. Thus, an ice archon hailscourge bound within a +2 longsword would give the longsword resist cold 10 (half that of the archon's), while an efreet fireblade bound within a wooden chest would give the chest resist 30 fire. While bound within an object the elemental cannot see or hear anything and can take no actions (not even speech). No creature has line of sight or line of effect to the elemental while it is bound within the object.

To perform this ritual you must make an Arcana check to determine the duration of the ritual and the size of the object that can be protected. If you try to protect an object that is larger than your check result, the ritual fails. 

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Duration	Maximum Size of Object
19 or lower	8 hours	Tiny
20-29	12 hours	Small
30-39	24 hours	Medium
40 or higher	1 week	Large&lt;/table&gt;

Once the ritual expires, the elemental creature appears in an unoccupied adjacent available space unharmed. If the object is destroyed, the elemental is also released, but loses one quarter of its total hit points.

While casting this ritual, you must choose both a target of the ritual and another creature to be an object of the target's obsession. You must make an Arcana check with a DC equal to the level of the target plus 15. If the target and the object are different races, you suffer a -5 penalty to your check, and if they are of different origins you suffer a -10 penalty. If the object is not the gender that the target is normally attracted to, you suffer an additional -10 penalty.

If your check is successful, the target becomes obsessed with the object of the ritual in a manner that can be mistaken for love. The target generally does what he or she can to be with the object of obsession and make the object happy, but the target does not change its fundamental nature. For example, even if a good creature is obsessed with a demon, the good creature will not slaughter innocents because the demon asks.

The Obsession ritual lasts for 24 hours, but you can extend this duration by expending 1 healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. This ritual never becomes permanent.

This ritual prevents a single creature named at the time of casting from taking a particular course of action. The course of action prescribed by this ritual can be anything from entering the king's castle too brushing one's teeth. The ritual can also prevent a creature from using a single daily, encounter, or rechargeable power, though in this circumstance, you must know that the creature possesses the power to begin with. While a creature cannot take the action for the duration of the ritual, it may still inadvertently take the action if forced to by another creature. Therefore, while the ritual would stop Edric the Usurper from entering the king's castle, it would not stop someone else from carrying him in against his will. You cannot stop a creature from taking involuntary actions, such as breathing. 

You can only perform this ritual if you possess a fetish created with the Create Fetish ritual (see pg. 24 for details). To successfully perform the ritual, you must be on the same plane of existence as the creature and make an Arcana or Religion check equal to the creature's level. If you fail this check, the creature is unaffected and the fetish becomes unusable. The fetish also becomes unusable once the duration ends.

You perform a ritual of exorcism to cast out a possessing demon or dispel a supernatural mental influence over the target's mind (such as the dominated condition). An exorcism differs from most other rituals in that instead of requiring a single skill check, it requires a series of skill checks in the format of a skill challenge. While the following skill challenge is provided as an example, the DM is encouraged to custom tailor his or her own skill challenges to fit the specific circumstances of any given possession.

Rite of Exorcism	Level: (Variable)
Skill Challenge
The caster suspects that the target is the victim of demonic possession, and uses his or her skills and ritual knowledge to expel the possessing fiend.

Level:
Equal to the level of the possessing fiend or caster of the mental control power.

Complexity:
2 (requires 6 successes before 3 failures).

Primary Skills:
Arcana, Religion, Nature

Victory:
The fiend is cast out of its host. If it was in the same plane of existence as the victim when it began the possession, it physically manifests and is stunned (save ends). If the fiend possessed its victim from a different plane of existence, then it is sent back to its home plane.

Defeat:
The fiend retains its hold on the host. The exorcist must make a successful saving throw or lose a healing surge due to psychic backlash. Others aiding the exorcist with the ritual do not risk psychic backlash in this way.

Arcana:
Hard DC (1 success, no maximum successes) You apply arcane knowledge and spellcraft to expel the possessor. On a failed check, the host loses a healing surge.
Religion:
Hard DC (1 success, no maximum successes) You resort to your faith and the strength of your convictions to drive out the possessing force as you burn holy incense and read sacred scriptures. On a failed check, the host loses a healing surge.

Nature:
Hard DC (1 success, no maximum successes) You burn rare herbs and spread the smoke over the victim as you call upon the forces of nature to remove the unnatural presence of the possessor from its host's body. On a failed check, the host loses a healing surge.

This ritual can only be cast on a living creature already called or trapped within a Magic Circle. You must be within 5 squares of the creature for the entire casting of the ritual, and if the Magic Circle is broken during this time, the ritual fails. Using Soul Engine on an unwilling creature is an evil act.

Soul Engine forges a link between a creature trapped within a Magic Circle and a single warding ritual of the same level as the creature or lower within 20 squares. The normal energy powering the ward is replaced by that of the life force of the creature trapped within the Magic Circle, and its duration changes to one day per level of the trapped creature. For each day that a creature powers the ward it loses all healing surges and cannot regain hit points. At the end of the final day, the creature dies as its life force is completely spent in powering the ward. Once this occurs, the ward also fails.

To successfully perform this ritual you must make an Arcana check. If the Arcana check is less that the creature's level + 10 the ritual fails, and the Magic Circle is broken, releasing the creature to its own devices.

When you perform this ritual you can link the life energy of you and up to four of your companions together, creating a pool of healing surges that the group can draw upon. All creatures involved in the ritual must remain within 5 squares of each other for the entire time it takes to perform the ritual, and all the creatures must be willing participants.

Once the ritual is complete you and your companions' available healing surges become equal to the total number of all your healing surges combined. Thus, four characters with 7, 9, 12 and 8 healing surges would have a total of 36 available healing surges in their pool. In addition, the healing surge value for the pool becomes equal to the creature with the highest healing surge value, granting all creatures in the pool the same number of hit points whenever they spend a healing surge.

Any time you or one of your companions uses a healing surge during the duration of the ritual, the healing surge is taken from the pool of healing surges rather than their own individual pool, allowing a member of your group to spend more healing surges than he normally could. This does not change the function of the healing surge nor does it alter any ability, power, or magic item that affects healing surges, such as how many times a creature can use second wind or how many hit points you can receive from a potion of vitality.

The ritual ends once all the healing surges in the pool are used up, the duration expires, or you and your companions take an extended rest or otherwise regain healing surges. If the ritual ends and there are still healing surges left in the pool, all remaining healing surges are divided as evenly as possible between the contributing participants, up to their normal maximum of healing surges.

Making a series of wild animal calls over the course of several minutes, you summon animals from the surrounding area to you. Only creatures with the natural origin and the beast type will answer the summons. These animals are called from a 1 mile radius, so only animals already in the area will answer the call. You may attempt to call a specific type of animal if your Nature check permits creatures of that size (see below), but if there are no animals of that type in range, the ritual fails and the components are wasted. You may attempt to call a specific animal if you know the animal's name or some way to differentiate it from others of its kind, but doing so imposes a -5 penalty on the Nature check to cast the ritual.

The animals will move as quickly as possible to your location, but if this takes more than an hour or proves impossible (due to ladders, cliffs, etc), they will stop and return to what they were doing. These animals have no special inclination to help you, but  will not attack you outright. The animals remain for 1 hour and may be targeted by other rituals, such as Animal Messenger or Animal Friendship. If any of the summoned animals are attacked the ritual immediately ends.

The Nature check result determines the size and number of animals summoned. The druid may willingly summon animals that would result from a lower Nature check result if desired.

&lt;table&gt;Nature Check Result	Animals Summoned
19 or lower	1-20 Tiny animals (squirrels, rats, frogs)
20-29	1-10 Small animals (dogs, cats, raccoons, hawks)

This ritual traps a single creature within a block of magical black, blue, or green ice. The creature to be trapped within the block of ice must be contained within a Magic Circle, and you must remain within 5 squares of the creature for the entire time it takes to perform the ritual.

Once the ritual is performed the creature instantly freezes as a rectangular block of opaque ice forms over its body. While frozen within the block of ice, the creature is restrained and does not have line of sight or line of effect to its surroundings. It cannot communicate with those outside of its icy prison except through telepathy, and cannot use any movement powers, including those with the teleportation keyword. While the creature takes no damage from the cold, it feels as if it were being bathed in liquid fire. The creature does not age, nor does it need to breathe or eat while trapped within the block (even though its mind is still active).

The block of ice created by this ritual is impervious to all damage by creatures or magic items of less than 20th level and to all cold damage. Against all other attacks the block has 20 hit points per level of the caster and defenses equal to 25 + half your level.

When you perform this ritual, you must make an Arcana check equal to 5 + the creature's level. If the ritual succeeds, the creature is trapped as above. If the ritual fails, you suffer a backlash of cold damage equal to your Arcana check result and the creature is freed from the Magic Circle.

This ritual is permanent until the block of ice is destroyed.

You create a mystic bond with a personal object or other symbol representing a person: a locket, ring, snippet of hair, garment, et cetera. This object must either be a part of the target's body or belong to the person and be of some personal significance (as determined by the DM). For example, you might be able to use a beloved tobacco pipe or paint brush with no appreciable value but intense personal significance, but leftovers from lunch are insufficient.

Most ritualists favor obtaining a lock of hair or a garment from the target, but the precise form the token takes is not germane to the ritual's function. What does matter is that it is symbolically represents the target in a future ritual - to do so, the item must have a strong psychic or  physical connection to the target.

An Attuned Focus makes magic easier to work against a specific target. You expend the focus' magic the next time you perform a ritual with the focus as the target, but the object itself is not destroyed. You may re-use the same object to create another Attuned Focus, if desired. Your Arcana, Nature, or Religion check result determines the precise benefits that this Attuned Focus provides. These bonuses are not cumulative.

You may only have one Attuned Focus for a particular target. If you make another, the magic of the first one fades instantly but the item itself is unharmed.

The skin functions as a magical cloak that fills your neck slot. The cloak grants you a +2 item bonus to your Fortitude, Reflex and Will defenses, and a +2 item bonus to Endurances checks to resist the effects of cold. Your Nature check determines how long the animal's spirit stays with you,

Using the corpse of a recently slain enemy, you create a magic pouch that helps you attack similar enemies when they are bloodied. You receive a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when fighting a bloodied enemy with the same monster name as the creature you used to create the pouch. The bonus does not apply against creatures with a different monster name, even if they are of the same origin and type. For example, a Blood Frenzy Pouch made from a gnoll huntmaster's corpse does not aid attacks against gnoll claw fighters or gnoll marauders. You must carry the Blood Frenzy Pouch on your person to receive this bonus. It does not occupy any item slots, but you can only carry one Blood Frenzy Pouch at any one time.	 

Your Arcana or Nature check determines how long the pouch remains effective. 

&lt;table&gt;Arcana or Nature Check Result	Duration
9 or lower	1 combat encounter
10-24	2 combat encounters

Aside from the listed component cost, the ritual also requires the use of components taken from the corpse of a recently slain enemy. The pouch must be created immediately after a battle, before characters take a short or extended rest. Otherwise, the components lose their "freshness" and can no longer be used. Once parts of a corpse have been used for one ritual, the corpse can no longer be used for any other ritual.

This hazardous ritual creates a bookworm mage, an entity possessing extraordinary knowledge in more than one field of study. As the ceremony unfolds, the parasites infesting the manuscripts present in a library - or any repository of knowledge - congregate with ordinary worms and maggots filling a vestment that once belonged to a larva mage (see 4E Monster Manual) and actually reawaken an echo of its former owner. This copy effectively possesses the skills of a real larva mage: Arcana +23, History +23, and Religion +23. In addition the bookworms present in the library carry knowledge of the fundamental subjects contained within the library, possibly adding Dungeoneering +17 and Nature +17 to the list, depending upon the books available (DM's choice). Thus, the bookworm mage can answer questions related to the knowledge it has, drawing on the fantastic reservoir the ritual has brought to its mind, which combines the previous experiences of the ex-larva mage and the library's whole contents. Moreover, the bookworm mage is literally converted into a walking catalog linked to the site where the ritual takes place, a guide that can point out the location of a specific book if required, even if the volume is hidden behind a secret door. However, the entity cannot physically retrieve the item itself, nor indicate the presence of traps if there are any.	

The longevity of the bookworm mage and the number of specific questions it can answer are determined during the ritual by your Arcana or Religion check. The consequences of a very low result are utterly disastrous; in that case, the ceremony not only fails; it creates an authentic larva mage instead, which is instantly hostile.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana or Religion Check Result	Duration	Number of Questions or Knowledge Checks	Side Effects
9 or lower	-	-	A genuine larva mage is created
10-19	1 hour	2	None
20-29	2 hours	4	None
30-39	4 hours	6	None
40 or higher	8 hours	8	None&lt;/table&gt; 

The entity continues to serve as guide even if it has answered the required number of questions. Thus, at anytime, astute characters can warp the letter of the ritual and still achieve their goal or advance their inquiries further. As example, "Tell me everything you know concerning The Mad Mage," is a request employing the entity's knowledge, while "Show me all the books containing references about The Mad Mage" uses the menial capacities of the bookworm mage instead.

You know how to use rare herbs to create the herbal concoctions listed below.

Antidote:
Each antidote only works on a specific kind of poison chosen at the time of its creation (for example, stormclaw scorpion venom). Anyone imbibing this concoction or applying it to a poisoned wound as a minor action may spend a healing surge to make an immediate saving throw to end ongoing poison damage with a +5 bonus.

Hallucinogen:
The imbiber is dazed (save ends).

Healing Salve:
When spread over the patient's wounds, the patient may spend a healing surge to regain up to 10 hit points at the rate of 1 per round.

Nauseant:
Anyone imbibing this concoction dazed and begins vomiting (save ends both).

Paralytic:
The imbiber of this concoction is slowed (save ends). If the imbiber fails the first save he or she becomes immobilized (save ends).

Poison: 
Anyone consuming this herbal concoction suffers an attack: +5 vs. Fortitude. On a hit, the target suffers ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends).

Relaxant: 
The imbiber of this concoction gains a +2 bonus to defenses and saves against fear effects and loses any bonuses gained from being bloodied (such as dragonborn's fury) or entering a rage (such as barbarian rages). Both effects persist until the end of the current encounter.

Remedy: 
Each herbal remedy only works on a specific disease (for example, filth fever) chosen at the time of its creation. Using an herbal remedy requires a minor action. The user may spend a healing surge to gain an immediate Endurance check against the disease with a +5 bonus. The Endurance check provided by an herbal remedy cannot cause the disease to worsen, no matter how bad the roll is.

Repellant: 
Each repellant only works against a specific type of natural beast (for example, insects) of 4th level and lower or lycanthropes (for example, werewolves) of 8th level or lower,
chosen at the time of its creation. Natural beasts above 4th level and lycanthropes above 8th level find herbal repellants irritating but are otherwise unaffected. When smeared on a specific creature or a specific square, creatures of the specified type must succeed on a saving throw before they can enter a square adjacent to that creature or square. Unprovoked creatures generally do not try to enter the area of effect more than once. Once applied, a repellant lasts for 1 day.

Sedative: 
The imbiber of this concoction becomes slowed and dazed (save ends both). If the imbiber fails the first save, he or she falls unconscious (save ends).

This ritual allows you to create a single disease of your choosing and place it within a foodstuff, creature, or water source. You can create any disease of up to your level per casting of the ritual. In addition, if you have personally ever been affected by the disease you are creating, the DC for Endurance checks by made to resist the disease increases by +2.

Placing the disease in a foodstuff or water source does not require any check, but placing it within a living creature requires an Arcana check equal to the creature's level. From that point on, the foodstuff, creature, or water source becomes a carrier for the disease and can pass on the contagion. Creatures may be able to pass on the disease with natural attacks (claw, bite, etc.). As a side effect of the ritual, you also become immune to any disease you create (but not other circumstances of the disease you may encounter). The length of time the carrier remains contagious depends on a number of different circumstances (determined by your GM).

Create Contagion is often combined with Aggravate Disease to create truly terrible maladies.

This potent ritual causes a druid's grove to come into existence. Nine oak trees sprout up over the course of 24 hours to encircle an area of natural land with a minimum radius of at least 10 squares. After the ritual is finished, the druid's grove becomes a reservoir of primal energy, allowing druids and other primal characters within the grove to perform miraculous feats of power. While the above description assumes that the grove is created in a temperate or subarctic forest, this need not be the case, and the nine oaks can be replaced by nine other plants found in the area. Thus, in a desert the nine oaks might be replaced with nine saguaro cacti, while in a tropical swamp they might be replaced with nine mangrove trees. Once the grove comes into existence, it counts as fantastic terrain.

Any plant creature such as a treant or shambling mound, and any creature that uses a power with the primal keyword gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls and a +1 bonus to damage rolls as long as they remain within the grove. This bonus increases to +2 at the paragon tier and +3 at the epic tier. In addition, any ritual that uses the Nature skill performed within the grove has its component cost and casting time halved. Finally, any warding ritual performed within the grove enlarges to encompass the grove's area even if it is larger than that allowed by the ritual. You can however, make the warding ritual smaller if need be.

Since it is a physical area, the grove can be destroyed if at least half of the oak trees or plants are cut down or otherwise killed. A typical druid oak is a Huge object with 300 hit points and a +5 bonus to all defenses (due to its magical nature). Any trees killed regrow within 24 hours unless enough trees are killed to destroy the grove.	

To successfully perform this ritual, you must be a druid. You can extend the duration of this ritual for an extra year by spending another 5 healing surges, but the ritual cannot be made permanent.

The maximum radius of the druid's grove and the number of oak trees or other plants that encircle it are determined by your Nature check.

The creature's alignment, level, type, or keyword is irrelevant for the purposes of the ritual as long as you have a tiny body part or possession taken from the creature such as a nail clipping, eyelash, or a brooch it once wore. This item is subsequently included in the construction of the fetish.	

While the fetish by itself possesses no power over the creature it resembles, the fetish is an essential component of the Pin the Soul ritual. In addition, anyone holding the fetish gains a +1 item bonus on Insight and Perception checks against the creature it is made to resemble. The fetish remains until it is used in the Pin the Soul ritual, where it is consumed.

You can create any non-magical, mundane item no larger than a two-handed weapon worth 100 gold pieces or less. The ritual can create only 'generic' items; it could create a padlock and key, but not a key to a locked door you have encountered. At the DMs discretion, Create Item can create multiples of a single item, so long as the total value does not exceed 100 gold pieces - it can create many arrows, for example. All items created are of good quality, but have no exceptional properties. They function normally in all respects. It is not possible to duplicate unique items, such as a signet ring, with this ritual; the items will be flawed or distorted in some way.

The component cost of the ritual is twice the value of the item being created.

From your primal connection to nature, you are able to turn any small stone or pebble into a lodestone. While held, the lodestone has no special properties; however, when placed on the ground it gently floats up a few inches, and then unerringly points north. This effect only functions in the world, and not on other planar locations (such as the Astral Sea or the Elemental Chaos). The lodestone functions for a duration based on your Nature check.

You leach the life force from nearby plants and transform it into residuum. This does not affect sentient creatures with the plant keyword, but instantly kills all other natural plant life. You also destroy all nutrients in the soil, preventing plants from returning for one year. While animals are not directly affected, the loss of food and shelter forces them to flee or perish.	 

The amount of residuum you receive and the amount of land you defile depends on your Arcana check. 

&lt;table&gt;Arcane Check Result	Value of Residuum Extracted	Radius of Destruction
9 or lower	100 gp	5 squares
10-19	1,000 gp	20 squares

You cannot extract residuum from an area with little or no plant life, including cities and deserts. If the available plant life is less than your Arcana check would affect, you extract residuum based on the area of available life. You may also choose to defile a smaller area of land and receive a lesser amount of residuum.

As you complete this ritual, you kill a living creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or greater. The creature must be helpless and adjacent to you while casting the ritual. As the creature dies, its life essence crystallizes into an amount of residuum based on the creature's level and your Arcana check.

&lt;table&gt;Arcane Check Result	Value of Residuum Extracted	Creature Level
9 or lower	500 gp	1-5
10-19	5,000 gp	6-10

50 or higher	1,000,000 gp	26 or higher&lt;/table&gt;

If your Arcana check is not high enough to affect the creature's level, the ritual fails. If the creature's level is lower than what your Arcana check would affect, then you receive residuum based on the creature's level.	

Creatures slain by this ritual are more difficult to return to life, and any rituals used to raise them (for example, Raise Dead), require an additional component of residuum equal to what you extracted from this ritual.

You can extend the duration of any ritual of the warding category with a listed duration of 24 hours. You may only extend a ritual that you have cast yourself. You must be within 20 squares and have line of sight to the warded object or area when you complete this ritual.

When Enduring Ward is completed, you bind the warding to a focus of silver and rubies. The focus must be worth 800 gp to extend a heroic tier warding ritual or worth twice the affected ritual's component cost for a paragon or epic tier ritual. A warding ritual that requires a non-monetary component cost (such as healing surges) cannot be affected by Enduring Ward.	 

The extended ritual's effects last as long as the focus remains within 20 squares of the warded area or object. You can hide or protect the focus in any way you like, as long as it remains within 20 squares of the warded area or object. If it is removed from the area, or destroyed, the enhanced ritual's effects end immediately.

Speaking ancient words of creation you fill an area with bright light that counts as sunlight for mundane purposes such as the growth of plants and the effects it has on various creatures, items or powers. The light lasts for one day, but can be extended for an extra day by spending a healing surge. If the ritual is sustained for a year and a day without interruption, it becomes permanent.

The radius of light provided by Eternal Sunshine is immobile, and can be mitigated by environmental factors such as rain, fog, or snow. Creatures making Stealth checks within the radius of Eternal Sunshine take a -5 penalty to their die rolls.	 

The radius of Eternal Sunshine is determined by a Nature or Religion check.

This ritual is used to teach spellcasters the basics regarding the fabrication of constructs. A suit of plate armor and an amount of roughly square or sculpted wood serves as principal elements in this case. The process is tedious and results into an imperfect design most of the time, but rewards the creator with his or her very first guardian. This construct is a pale and weaker copy of the real shield or battle guardians, but a construct that is nonetheless linked to the caster by an amulet just like the real thing, though this crude creation often remains active only for a limited period of time. However, some very promising or plain lucky pupils and casters of higher levels seeking to build unsophisticated constructs sometimes achieve a wholly stable matrix.	 

Your Arcana check determines how long the first guardian stays operational; once this period of time is passed, the artificial humanoid falls apart and cannot be salvaged; even the amulet acting as a link is destroyed. At this stage, a low check also means that the construct has one or more flaws. 

&lt;table&gt;Arcane Check Result	Duration	Flaw

This ritual creates an extradimensional pocket or demiplane that serves as a place where you and your companions can rest, study, cast rituals, train, or keep treasure. The demiplane takes whatever shape and appearance you desire within the parameters of the ritual and can include areas of difficult, blocking, and hazardous terrain if you desire. The demiplane is empty of buildings or structures, but these can be added later. The demiplane is normally brightly lit, but you can modify the lighting when you cast the ritual (so that it is eternally dark or shrouded in dim light). The entrance to the demiplane usually takes the form of a simple wooden doorway, but you can modify it to make it look like a stone or iron door.

When you create the demiplane, you designate up to eight individuals (you must include yourself). These individuals are the only ones who can see or enter the demiplane. Other creatures cannot perceive or enter the demiplane, nor can they affect it with any magic. Because the demiplane is an extradimensional space, certain magic items that access extradimensional spaces (such as bags of holding) become inaccessible within the demiplane.	

When you perform this ritual you must make two Arcana checks. The first is to determine the area of the demiplane, while the second determines the length of time the demiplane persists. 

&lt;table&gt;Arcane Check Result	Demiplane Size	Duration
29 or lower	Burst 10	24 hours
30-39	Burst 20	1 week
40 or higher	Burst 30	1 month&lt;/table&gt; 

If the demiplane vanishes while creatures or objects are still inside it, they appear in the closest safe location to the demiplane's entrance.

Focus: 
The focus for this ritual is an astral diamond. The astral diamond merges with the demiplane when the ritual is performed and returns to its natural state once the ritual ends.

When you cast this ritual, you become cloaked in heavenly vestments that give you a more commanding presence than you would normally have. Make a Religion check and add the result as a bonus to all Diplomacy or Intimidate checks you make during the ritual's duration.	

You need not choose which skill (Diplomacy or Intimidate) while casting the ritual; however, the first time you apply the ritual's bonus to either Diplomacy or Intimidate, the raiment becomes attuned, and its bonus can only be applied to that skill for the duration of the ritual.

The vestments are created of the most expensive of materials, including gems and fine silks. If you should remove the vestments before the duration expires, they disappear. The vestments do not interfere with armor or other garments. 

You can cause the raiment to vanish as a minor action.

Using the corpse of a recently slain enemy, you create a magic pouch that helps you attack similar enemies. At the time of the pouch's creation, choose either Fortitude, Reflex, or Will; you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls against the chosen defense when fighting an enemy with the same monster name as the creature you used to create the pouch. The bonus does not apply against creatures with a different monster name, even if they are of the same origin and type. For example, a Hunter's Pouch made from a hobgoblin archer's corpse does not aid attacks against hobgoblin soldiers or warcasters. You must carry the Hunter's Pouch on your person to receive this bonus. It does not occupy any item slots, but you can only carry one Hunter's Pouch at any one time.

Your Arcana or Nature check determines how long the pouch remains effective.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana or Nature Check Result	Duration
9 or lower	1 combat encounter
10-24	2 combat encounters
25-39	3 combat encounters
40 or higher	4 combat encounters or until the character takes an extended rest&lt;/table&gt;

Aside from the listed component cost, the ritual also requires the use of components taken from the corpse of a recently slain enemy. The pouch must be created immediately after a battle, before characters take a short or extended rest. Otherwise, the components lose their "freshness" and can no longer be used. Once parts of a corpse have been used for one ritual, the corpse can no longer be used for any other ritual.

This ritual creates a sumptuous banquet for up to sixteen Medium individuals. The meal appears on a table decorated with crystal goblets and dishes, bouquets of flowers and herbs, fine silver cutlery and a silken tablecloth, and consists of multiple courses. Virtually any foodstuff can be reproduced by the banquet, and it is always of the finest quality. The King's Banquet lasts for 1 hour before it vanishes, taking every item with it.	

Unlike Travelers Feast, which creates trail rations or similar portable and longer lasting food, the food created by King's Banquet is meant for immediate consumption, and the ritual is normally performed when you want to impress someone or are holding a celebration of some kind. As a result, the food and wine created by King's Banquet is filling but often not nutritious or healthy. 

While King's Banquet normally has no game benefits, it can be used as part of a diplomatic skill challenge, such as when trying to win over a wealthy patron or convince two parties to sign a peace treaty. In this situation, King's Banquet can provide as much as a +2 bonus to you and your companions' skill checks. 

The number of people that King's banquet can feed is determined by an Arcana check.

Through this long and exhausting ritual, you create an exact mock copy of yourself. The copy comes to life as soon as the ritual is completed. It has almost the same appearance, alignment, mannerisms and personality as you, except for a few slight details chosen by the DM, such as a particular behavior, a distinctive personality trait of its own, a lighter skin, darker eyes, etc. These differences are never serious enough to enable anyone to discriminate right away between the mock self and you.

Someone familiar with you that views or interacts with the mock self, however, is entitled to an Insight check to realize the differences. The check DC equals your Arcana check result. Anyone familiar with you is allowed a check the first time they see the mock self and each time they interacts with it.

You can give your mock self a pattern of actions and orders no longer than one sentence at the moment of its creation. The mock self otherwise acts exactly as you would; save for the tiny differences chosen by the DM.

The mock self has the same statistics as a clay scout homunculus (see 4E Monster Manual) except for its size and alignment, which are the same as yours. You can also choose one skill you are trained in at the beginning of the ritual and give it to the mock self. The mock self has the same bonus in this skill as you.

The mock self rolls a saving throw every time you take an extended rest. If the mock self fails its saving throw, it instantly crumbles to dust.

You draw upon the primal forces of nature and speed up time for any non-living natural wooden object within the area of effect, causing it up undergo the petrifaction process which would normally take centuries, turning it to stone within minutes. Your Nature check determines the area you can affect and how long the effects last.

20-29	Burst 5	6 hours

The object attains the properties of stone, doubling the hit points of the object, among other effects such as weight, inability to burn, etc. All wooden objects within the area of effect are affected, allowing multiple objects to be transformed at once.  

Carved wooden objects such as statues, plates, bowls, and arrowheads may be affected as well, making the objects more useful or valuable (sculpted objects usually being more valuable and durable than a carved one.) Wooden walls could be made stone, doors can be made stronger, a rope bridge could be made to collapse due to the added weight, or any other effect could be achieved through this ritual.

The object(s) return to their original wooden composition upon expiration of the effects, remaining in whatever form they then possess (A shattered object becomes a collection of wooden pieces of the same shape as the shattered stone.)

This ritual vastly accelerates the growth of plants in the targeted area, causing them to grow to full maturity over the course of the ritual casting. This ritual affects all manner of plants, from crops to trees to seaweed. The plants do not need anything other than soil, and will grow in the face of drought, poor soil conditions, or lack of sunlight. The squares affected by this ritual can provide concealment, cover, or count as difficult terrain at the DM's discretion.

If anything impedes the growth of the plant, such as a roof, the plant will try to grow around the obstruction or push it out of the way. This can cause damage to buildings and structures as determined by your Nature check. Your Nature check result also determines the area affected; the burst created is centered on the square the ritual is cast in.	

&lt;table&gt;Nature Check Result	Area Affected	Effect on Structures
9 or lower	Burst 2	None
10-19	Burst 4	Temporary structures destroyed

Structures destroyed by this ritual become difficult terrain. The destruction process is slow and takes several minutes to complete, so unless a creature is unconscious or helpless in the structure, it can escape without difficulty. Unconscious or helpless characters take damage equal to the Nature check result.

This ritual creates a Gargantuan castle for you to use as a headquarters, fortification, or for some other purpose. The castle appears in the spot you select, ignoring the surrounding terrain as it rises, crushing or displacing any creatures and objects of size Large or smaller in its way (though the castle rises slowly enough that most creatures can escape its path unless unconscious or incapacitated). The ritual automatically fails if attempted in an area already occupied by a creature or object of size Huge or larger, such as a copse of trees or another building, or if there is not enough room for it to assume its full size; for instance, if it were created atop a narrow pinnacle of rock.

The exact dimensions of the castle depend on the result of your Arcana check.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Castle Dimensions
9 or lower	10 squares by 10 squares and 5 squares high (minimum 2 floors)
10-19	20 squares by 20 squares and 10 squares high (minimum 3 floors)
20-29	30 squares by 30 squares and 15 squares high (minimum 4 floors)
30 or higher	50 squares by 50 squares and 20 squares high (minimum 5 floors)&lt;/table&gt;

The walls, floor, and ceiling of the castle are constructed of solid granite, and include battlements where appropriate. The front entrance is constructed of adamantine and can include a wooden drawbridge at your discretion. Windows or arrow slits for archers are optional, but can be placed anywhere along the walls.	 

The standard (smallest size) castle contains an audience chamber, barracks, kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. Additional rooms such as guard chambers, trophy halls, summoning chambers, or extra bedrooms can be added as you see fit, but may reduce the size of existing chambers. None of the chambers come with furnishings or other accoutrements. These must be included later. 

Once created, the castle is permanent and nonmagical, and can be damaged and repaired as any normal structure. While the castle can be created in any terrain, the castle can be damaged or even destroyed later by being placed in hostile terrain or in an area unsuitable for building, such as in a swamp, on top of a mountain, or in the path of a lava flow.

This ritual allows you to create a specially prepared ritual circle that makes ritual casting easier. You imbue 3-square-by-3-square area with arcane, natural, or divine energy, making the circle particularly suited to your magic.	

When you create the circle, choose one skill that you are trained in from the following list: Arcana, Nature, or Religion. The choice is made when you create the circle and cannot be changed. When you perform rituals in the circle, you add +2 to the check result for the selected skill and reduce the ritual's component cost by 10% or 50 gp (whichever is less).  

You can recast this ritual on the same sigils before the circle is exhausted. Doing so adds to the number of rituals that you may perform before exhausting the circle. 

Your check result determines how many rituals the Ritual Circle assists you in performing before the magic is exhausted.

You create a duplicate that looks and acts exactly like you. It knows all that you knew at the time of its creation. It has duplicates of your non-magical gear, but if removed from the simulacrum, the gear instantly turns into snow. The simulacrum obeys all commands you give to it, including those that are obviously suicidal. In your absence, it carries out your desires as best as it can, based on its knowledge. 

In combat, the simulacrum uses your defenses but has only 1 hit point (a miss never damages a simulacrum). It uses your attack bonus, but may only make basic attacks. 

Any creature that interacts with the simulacrum can make an Insight check with a DC equal to your Arcana check to realize that the simulacrum is a fake. If the simulacrum is destroyed, it turns to snow, and it is automatically clear that it was not real.

This ritual causes a Tiny inanimate object such as a child's toy, house plant, hand mirror, or bowl to come to life; granting it a spark of intelligence and causing the object to sprout tiny limbs and facial features, such as eyes, a nose, and a mouth. The object must remain within 5 squares of you for the time necessary to perform the ritual, and the ritual can animate only permanent, non-magical items. Any implements transformed into living creatures can no longer be used for their original purpose.	

Once the object is animated, it gains a speed of 2 squares, hit points equal to your healing surge value, defenses and an attack bonus equal to 10 + half your level, and can make a melee basic attack for 1d3 damage. The object has 3 Strength due to its size, and a base score of 10 for the rest of its ability scores, including Intelligence. It also possesses basic human senses such as eyesight and hearing. The object makes all skill checks untrained and can speak a single language you know (its default language is Common). An item transformed into a creature starts off as unaligned.  

Creatures you create by using this ritual are normally loyal to you, but like any intelligent creature, can turn against you if poorly treated. If an item animated by this ritual is destroyed it cannot be raised.

This ritual enables you to create a useful ally from the corpse of a common cat, a near intangible entity that possesses extraordinary talents and which can deliver a single, potentially devastating attack at your command. Your Religion check determines the "life expectancy" of this eerie feline made of swirling shadows and the amount of necrotic damage it delivers if you ever sacrifice it.

9 or lower	1d6+1	1day

A spectral cat is engendered from the remains of a household feline, which are ritually embalmed and placed in a canopic jar. The spectral cat never strays far from this vessel - no more than 5 squares, regardless the circumstances - thus it must be carried along by its owner.	

The spectral cat is a creepy, unnerving presence that instills a supernatural terror in those who come across its path; common rodents, such as mice and rats, and their monstrous counterparts - giant rats, dire rats, and rat swarms - shun it altogether, and cannot approach within 2 squares. Other creatures within 2 squares of the spectral cat suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls; creatures immune to fear do not suffer this effect. 

The spectral cat is utterly impervious to physical and magical attacks, but can be targeted by dispel magic. Being insubstantial, the feline isn't hindered by solid barriers, but it cannot enter a magically warded area at all. 

The spectral cat can fetch small, unattended objects weighing no more than one pound and bring them back if instructed to do so.

At any time the spectral cat can deliver a single attack (standard action) against a target you designate within 5 squares The shadowy feline unerringly strikes the creature and instantly vanishes, delivering an amount of necrotic damage determined at the time of its creation as specified in the table above.

A spectral cat faithfully stays at your side for the duration stipulated in the table above or until it is sacrificed. In both cases, the mummified cat used at the time of the ritual crumbles to dust, though the canopic jar that held the animal can be reused.

Focus: 
A ritually prepared canopic jar worth at least 50 gp.

You cast this ritual on an item taken from the body of the creature you intend to target with the Observe Creature ritual. The item must have once been part of the creature's body, such as a lock of hair, a tooth, nail clippings, or a patch of skin.	

If this item is then used as a component in the Observe Creature ritual you do not need to describe the target as you would normally when casting that ritual. The ritual unerringly targets the creature from which the component was taken as long as that creature is on your plane. 

This item also grants a +2 bonus to your Arcana check when casting Observe Creature. A scrying sensor created when this component is used grants you a +4 bonus to any opposed Wisdom checks the target of Observe Creature makes to destroy the sensor.

Using the corpse of a recently slain enemy, you create a magic pouch that helps protect you against attacks from similar enemies. At the time of the pouch's creation, choose either Fortitude, Reflex, or Will; you gain a +1 bonus to the chosen defense against attacks from enemies with the same monster name as the creature you used to create the pouch. You do not receive this bonus against attacks from creatures with a different monster name, even if they are of the origin and type. For example, a Warder's Pouch made from a drow arachnomancer will not protect you against the spells of a drow priest. You must carry the Warder's Pouch on your person to receive this bonus. It does not occupy any item slots, but you can only carry one Warder's Pouch at any one time.

Your Arcana or Nature check determines how long the pouch remains effective.

Aside from the listed component cost, the ritual also requires the use of components taken from the corpse of a recently slain enemy. The pouch must be created immediately after a battle, before characters take a short or extended rest. Otherwise, the components lose their "freshness" and can no longer be used. Once parts of a corpse have been used for one ritual, the corpse can no longer be used for any other ritual.

Using blood from a recently slain enemy, you paint gruesome patterns and sigils on your face that terrify those who behold you. You receive a bonus on your next Intimidate check before the duration of the ritual expires.

Your Arcana check determines the modifier to your next Intimidate check:

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Bonus to Intimidate Checks
19 or lower	+1
20-29	+2
30-39	+5
40 or higher	+7&lt;/table&gt;

Aside from the listed component cost, the ritual also requires the use of components taken from the corpse of a recently slain enemy. The Blood Mask must be created immediately after a battle, before characters take a short or extended rest. Otherwise, the components lose their "freshness" and can no longer be used. Once parts of a corpse have been used for one ritual, the corpse can no longer be used for any other ritual. The Blood Mask remains for 24 hours or until you make an Intimidate check.

You channel a bit of fey glamour, and the object fades into the background, becoming much more difficult to find for those who do not know what they are looking for. You do not make the object invisible - it just appears nondescript. Eyes seem to pass over it unless they know specifically what they are seeking. Your Arcana check determines the DC of Perception checks made to see through the glamour, as well as the area of effect. An active Perception check must be made, as a passive Perception check cannot find a camouflaged object.
 
&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Affected Area
19 or lower	A small object, such as a trapdoor (burst 1)
20-29	A small building or landmark (burst 5)
30-39	A large building or landmark, such as a castle (burst 10)
40 or higher	An entire town or small city (burst 50)&lt;/table&gt;

You can cause the glamour to last an additional 24 hours by expending the component cost again, though this requires you to be near the camouflaged object.

If a creature spots the camouflaged object with a Perception check, it can point out the camouflaged object to others.

Being careful not to step inside, you draw a circle on the ground composed of dozens of runes of love, peace, compassion, and romance. The circle can be large enough to fill a room of moderate size (or a burst 2 area), although smaller circles can be created. Upon completing the ritual, the runes vanish, but the power of the Circle of Amorous Intensions remains. The first person who enters the area where the runes formerly laid feels nothing amiss. However, should a second person enter the Circle, they feel particularly well disposed to anyone already inside. Effectively, this grants a bonus to all Diplomacy checks the first person who entered the Circle makes against the second while both remain within. Your Arcana check determines the exact bonus granted by the Circle.
 
&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Bonus to Intimidate Checks
19 or lower	+1
20-29	+2
30-39	+5

Despite the name of this ritual, the bonus granted applies to any Diplomacy check, not just those of a romantic nature. Although potentially useful in many types of negotiations, the Circle has been named for what is, perhaps unfortunately, its most common use.

Should any other person enter the area of the ritual's effect, or should either person in this area be addressed, attacked, or otherwise contacted by anyone outside the Circle, the duration of the ritual immediately ends.

Note that although the runes vanish upon completion of the ritual, it is possible for a person affected by the Circle's power to recognize that they are being manipulated. An Insight check with a DC equal to your Arcana check allows someone in the Circle to recognize they are being influenced by an outside force. Once this influence is detected, a DC 22 Arcana check identifies the exact source of the effect. Neither detecting nor identifying the Circle of Amorous intent disrupts its immediate effectiveness, however. Still, much to the dismay of many a potential paramour, few who learn they were subjected to this ritual against their will continue to feel pleasantly towards the one responsible once freed from the Circle's power.

This ritual causes a single dead or undead creature to take on the appearance of a living creature. The creature takes on a healthy appearance, and if dead, merely appears to be resting or asleep. Missing body parts are restored and even skeletons or insubstantial undead can be made to look as if they are alive.

The visage created by this ritual is merely an illusion, and does not change the condition of a dead body or any olfactory or auditory effects that might accompany a corpse or undead creature (such as the stench of a zombie or the creaking of a skeleton's bones). It doesn't grant an undead creature any abilities it doesn't normally have, nor does it prevent any abilities the undead creature already has from working, though the use of any powers might instigate an Insight check (see below).

Creatures that view or interact with the dead or undead creature are entitled to an Insight checks to detect that the visage created by the ritual is false. This check's DC equals your Arcana check result. A creature is allowed a check the first time it sees the dead body or undead creature, and each time it interacts with it. Unlike normal illusions, touching a dead body or undead creature masked by this ritual does not automatically detect it for what it is.

You must be within 20 squares of the effect of the ritual to be extended when you complete the Continuous Deception ritual. Once completed, you can extend the duration of the affected ritual by expending a healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. You do not need to be in the same area or even on the same plane to sustain the effect. If you sustain the effect without interruption for a year and a day, the effect becomes permanent.

You create an illusionary object called a glamer. The illusionary object is fully functional, but disappears after it is used to make a successful attack (for example, an illusionary weapon), after it is used to assist a skill check (for example, illusionary lock picks), after it is hit by an attack, or after it makes physical contact with cold iron. In order to create an illusionary object, you must make an Arcana check with a DC equal to the listed value, in gold pieces, of a mundane version of the object being created (so creating an illusionary longsword is DC 15). Illusionary weapons act just like real weapons, except that they disappear after delivering a successful attack and they deal psychic damage instead of their normal damage type.

Illusionary objects created by this ritual always appear to be ornately decorated and of the finest craftsmanship. Anyone visibly wearing or carrying one or more glamer objects radiates an aura of impressiveness and gains a +1 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks.

This ritual is among the most subtle of all deception rituals. The Dance of the Peacock is often performed by more cunning and rakish casters without their targets ever even knowing they are doing so. And some casters have found intricate and subtle ways in which to weave the necessary gestures and incantations of the ritual into dances, songs, and even conversations! Though the ritual is widely known as the Dance of the Peacock for its often showy displays and ultimately intoxicating effect upon a target, it can take almost any form, so long as its caster can subtly apply certain incantations and reagents at the appropriate times during its casting.

To cast the ritual, you must engage the attention of your intended target. Doing so may involve garnering the target's undivided attention during some sort of performance, or simply by involving the target in uninterrupted conversation. In certain circumstances, you might even bind up your target to the point of helplessness, so it has no other choice but to witness the ritual. If, for any reason, the target's attention is drawn away from you during the casting of the ritual, you 
lose the component cost, but not the focus of the ritual.

Once you have the target's attention, the ritual begins, in whatever form you choose. During the performance, you may choose to make a Bluff check. The target makes an Insight check in opposition to your Bluff check to determine if it realizes it is the target of the ritual. You may also forgo the Bluff check, but doing so means the target is automatically aware that a ritual is being performed and that it is, in fact, the target. It is up to the DM's discretion to determine how the target reacts to the realization of being targeted with such an enchantment.

Assuming you are able to complete the ritual, upon completion, make a Charisma vs. Will attack against the target. If you hit, the target falls deeply in love with you, and you then make an Arcana check. The Arcana check serves to determine the duration before which the target may make a saving throw to end the effect. A target who is in love with you is assumed to always have a friendly attitude, and will be as helpful to you as possible. The target will not, however, commit suicidal acts on your behalf, nor is it magically compelled to obey you. It retains its normal judgment and sense of self-preservation.

Focus: 
Any item of value (at least 360 gp) presented as a gift to or sacrificed in honor of the target of the ritual.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	When the Target is Allowed a Saving Throw
9 or lower	At the end of each of its turns until it successfully saves
10-19	Each minute until it successfully saves
20-29	Each hour until it successfully saves
30-39	Each day until it successfully saves
40 or higher	Each week until it successfully saves&lt;/table&gt;

You ward a single room (or a burst 4 area) against eavesdropping. Creatures listening to something in the warded area from outside hear a carefully programmed audible illusion instead of what is really in the room. 

When you cast the ritual, you determine the extent and parameters of the illusion. You can cause a sound as quiet as a whispering couple or as loud as yelling or fighting creatures to emanate from the area. You can produce non-vocal sounds such as the panting of guard dogs, the clank of mugs and eating utensils, or even strains of music. Anyone listening into the area hears exactly what you determine when you cast the ritual.

When a creature listens into the warded area, that creature makes an Insight check, using your check result +5 as the DC. If the listener succeeds on the check, it realizes that the sounds are illusory. Otherwise, the creature believes that what it hears is actually there and acts accordingly.

The illusion of a moon appears in the sky, directly in front of the sun, blocking the sun's rays for a brief time. The effect is localized to a 1 mile radius from the casting location. During the eclipse, the light level is similar to normal nighttime, newmoon light levels.

Your Arcana check determines the duration of the eclipse.

This ritual works much like Forbiddance. It prevents teleportation into a specific area unless the caster is higher level than the ritual caster who performed False Portal.

Your Arcana check determines the size of the area False Portal affects, which is a burst.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Area Protected
9 or lower	Burst 1
10-19	Burst 3
20-29	Burst 5
30-39	Burst 8
40 or higher	Burst 12&lt;/table&gt;

However, instead of completely blocking teleportation, False Portal shunts anyone attempting to teleport into this area to a new place you choose while casting the ritual.

Creatures attempting to teleport into the area view it as they would normally when employing a teleportation ritual. If they watch another creature step through the portal, the creature appears to have safely traveled to the desired destination. Any creature about to step through the teleportation portal is entitled to an Insight check to detect the portal's true destination. This check's DC equals your Arcana check result.

When choosing the new destination, you are limited to places you have seen, and must exactly describe the location as you would if you were casting True Portal. The alternate terminal must be on your plane.

The ritual lasts for 24 hours, but you can extend this duration by expending a healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. You do not need to be in the same area or even on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the effect becomes permanent.

Upon completing the ritual, choose an area it will affect, make an Arcana check, and describe the details of exactly what you would like those who attempt to look upon the area to see. The area you choose may be up to a size dictated by your Arcana check. You may choose to have literally any illusory auditory and visual effects within the area you influence with the ritual. If any creature uses a scrying ritual or item to attempt to view any object or creature within the designated area, they perceive, instead of what is actually there, whatever illusions you have programmed.

A few occurrences can foil this ritual. The onlooker can make an Insight check to realize that what he sees is illusory. The DC of the Insight check is equal to the Arcana check you made at the completion of the ritual. If the onlooker beats your Arcana check by 5 or more, he not only realizes it is illusory, but also perceives what is actually in the affected area instead of the illusory program. Further, if a creature views the area over an extended period of time, and that time is longer than the programmed illusion, it perceives the illusion in a continuous loop and may realize the ruse. Moreover, if the duration of this ritual ends while the area is being observed, the illusions fade away. Finally, if the onlooker's sensor moves outside of the designated area, it begins to receive true visions that may be inconsistent with the programmed illusion, or otherwise receive clues to the fact that the area affected by the ritual was illusory.

Your Arcana check result determines the area you can affect with the ritual:

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Area Affected
19 or lower	Burst 5
20-29	Burst 20
30-39	Any large area or edifice (roughly equivalent to a castle in area)

Your body's functions slow to near imperceptible levels, giving you the rigidity and pallor of one recently deceased (no rot, odor, or other malady of the long-dead).

As the ritual is completed, you drop prone in the space in which you performed the ritual and make a Religion check. The result of the check is the DC for Insight or Heal checks to determine that you are, in fact, alive. The result of your Religion check also determines how long the ritual lasts. Though your eyes close and you drift into a deep, catatonic state, you retain a vague sense of your surroundings.

Make an Arcana check instead of a Bluff check in order to create a disguise. Your check result becomes the DC of any Insight checks made to recognize the illusion. A successful Insight check does not mean that a person recognizes you; they simply know that your current face is not real. 

The glamour can be made to resemble almost any image you can think of. The ritual can alter your perceived race, gender, and all other physical features. The illusion can change your perceived height and weight, but it cannot make you look like a creature that is a different size category than your own. The glamour can be as specific as imitating a particular individual or as general as, "Make me look like a hobgoblin soldier." If you are vague when designating what you want to look like, then the ritual makes as few changes as possible. Commands such as, "Give me a new face" or "Make me handsome" prompts the ritual to create a glamour that closely resembles your natural state.

 You must select a specific helpless but conscious creature and perform the entire ritual in its presence. Once you complete the ritual (elements of which might include displaying objects of pain or making terrible threats) the creature comes to regard you as the living embodiment of its future misery and does whatever it takes to placate you. So long as you remain in the creature's presence, and the creature continues to be helpless (tied up, bound by magic, etc) you may make an Arcana or Religion check with a +10 bonus in the place of Intimidate checks against it. Once you leave the creature's presence, or it is no longer helpless, even if just for a moment, the duration of the ritual expires.
 
This ritual only affects creature which are normally subject to Intimidate checks. Similarly, it does not endow you with any special means of communication with the creature. If you do not share a language with the creature, you may use a translator, attempt to get your point across with gestures, or employ other means to communicate.

You create an illusion of an organized military making camp in a particular location. The force consists of 1,000 creatures, of sizes between Small and Large. The soldiers of the hallucinatory regiment sounds and smell like the real thing. The soldiers speak, but only in cliche phrases commonly attributed to soldiers.

The members of the hallucinatory regiment make no attempt to hide their presence. The soldiers within the camp prepare themselves for battle, illusionary guards patrol the camp's parameter, and camp followers perform various tasks for the soldiers. At night, camp fires are built and a meal is served.

Creatures that view or interact with the illusion are entitled to Insight checks to detect that it is false. The check DC is equal to your Arcana check result. Creatures are allowed a check each time they interact with the illusion. A creature that touches the illusion automatically determines that it is false.

You create the illusion of a group of spectators. The creatures must be of Small to Large size and of the same general race or type (such as a mixed crowd of humans, goblins, and elves). The illusory crowd perfectly matches the physical appearance of the chosen creatures, and can display a limited range of auditory behavior including booing, cheering, clapping, jeering, shouting, whistling, and engaging in mumbled conversation (though those listening to it quickly realize it is meaningless babble).

When you cast this ritual you select a single minor action and move action for the creatures to perform, as well as two of the auditory behaviors described above (these count as free actions). Therefore, you could cause the illusions to rise to their feet and begin clapping and cheering before making them sit back down again, or cause them to mill around a ballroom talking.
 
&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Number of Spectators
19 or lower	5
20-29	10
30-39	20
40 or higher	100&lt;/table&gt; 

The illusions can be instructed to perform an action in response to a specific trigger, such as an opponent falling in combat or acting in a repetitive sequence, such as moving to and pointing at a spot while booing and jeering. All of the spectators must be involved in the same action, thus you could not cause some of the spectators to remain standing while the rest sat down.

Creatures that view or interact with the illusions are entitled to Insight checks to detect the fact that they are false. This check's DC is equal to your Arcana check. A creature is allowed to check the first time it sees the illusions and each time it interacts with them. A creature that touches the spectators immediately realizes they are not real.

The illusions cannot travel more than 20 squares from the spot where they first appeared.

The Incognito allows you to designate up to eight ritual participants, including yourself, who gain an illusory disguise. You and your allies still appear as you are, but all creatures around no longer recognize you as anyone they have seen before. It is if you have become strangers. No one recognizes you unless you, or anyone else, specifically reveal your identity; if that happens, the ritual is broken, and you instantly become recognizable to everyone that might recognize you.

Your Arcana check determines the duration of the illusory disguise.

Popular amongst both court mages and adventurers, this ritual causes a moderately sized room or clearing (of burst 3 area or smaller) to take on a magnificence that would impress all but the most jaded of royalty. Inside this area, the poorest of food appears to turn into sumptuous delicacies, the shabbiest of clothes into finery, and the basest of furniture becomes comfortable beyond compare. It's all an illusion, of course. Lap of Luxury doesn't actually create anything; it merely grants existing goods a glamour of luxury. Anything brought outside the area of the ritual assumes its true form immediately, and an Insight check with a DC equal to your Arcana check allows someone unknowingly affected by the ritual to detect that all this richness is not quite real. However, few are foolish enough to voluntarily try and escape the effects of Lap of Luxury, even if they realize they are being pleasantly deceived.

Although most often used to provide for the comfort of traveling nobles, the ritual has a much more practical application. Anyone who remains within the Lap for its full duration is considered to have taken an extended rest, gaining all the benefits thereof. Actually sleeping is unnecessary, but those within the Lap are certainly free to do so.

When you cast this ritual, you are able to manipulate the dreams of a sleeping creature into the most horrible, fearinducing events you can imagine. The images interrupt the sleeper's recovery and prevent it from gaining all of the benefits of an extended rest. These images remain in the sleeper's mind and prevent it from taking an extended rest until twenty-four hours have passed. 

You need not personally know or have ever seen the subject, but when performing the ritual you must possess a focus as described below. The focus allows you to affect the target without having to describe the creature. All that is required is you know the name of the ritual's target.

To disturb a creature's sleep you must succeed on an attack against the target's Will defense with your Arcana check as the attack roll. Otherwise, the ritual fails and the components are expended. Your Arcana check determines how far you can be from a sleeper and still manipulate its dreams. If the intended target is out of range at the time of the ritual's casting, the ritual fails and the components are expended. Your Arcana check also determines deleterious effects you produce in the victim, as shown on the chart below.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Distance	Effect on Target
19 or lower	10 miles	Cannot regain hit points or healing surges
20-29	40 miles	Starts each day with no action points
30-39	100 miles	Loses the ability to use daily or recharge powers
40 or higher	200 miles	Must spend an action point to use a healing surge or second wind&lt;/table&gt;

The effects are cumulative. For example, an Arcana check of 30 means the victim regains no hit points or healing surges lost the previous day, begins the day with no action points, and cannot use daily powers or those with a recharge roll.

Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as Magic Circle, can block Nightmares.

If the ritual's target gets an uninterrupted extended rest the ritual's effects are removed. You may prevent this by casting the ritual each night.

Creatures that do not require sleep are immune to this ritual's magic.

Focus: 
An item from the creature's body such as nail clippings, a lock of hair, or a patch of skin.

An illusory mask representing your own features superimposes itself over your true visage; this pretense conveys your most convincing facial expressions as the need arises. Thus your Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Streetwise checks can potentially be enhanced by this ritual; this traduces into a +3 bonus to all relevant checks. As a side effect, even your Insight checks can benefit from this ritual.

Your Arcana check determines how many skills profit from the +3 bonus, and for how long. You know the exact number of skills that receive the bonus, and decide which skill(s) you want to improve among those already mentioned above, with the exception of Insight, which is accessible only with a check result of 30 and higher.

While appearing to provide a beneficial, restful enchantment to protect your camp and provide healing vibrations to those under your care, you are, in fact, draining the targets of the ritual and preventing them from recovering from wounds and other maladies.

Choose an area up no larger than a burst 10 when casting this ritual. You may designate up to five creatures in the area as targets of the ritual. Each target must take an extended rest within that area for the ritual to have an effect upon them. Upon completion of the ritual, make an Arcana check. The result of the check serves as both the DC of Insight checks made to uncover your ruse and to determine what effects the ritual has on those within its area of effect. Any effect listed under a lower check result than what you rolled is cumulative with effects listed under your check result.

Upon completion of the ritual, choose a specific origin and type of creature. You and up to five allies you designate become invisible and silent to that type of creature (i.e. Perception checks automatically fail to notice you) for a short time. Though creatures of that type cannot detect you by normal senses, magical means of perception can foil the ritual's effects. The effects of the ritual last just long enough for your party to skirt past an enemy or group of enemies and avoid an encounter. If you open a door, trigger a trap, or do something else to draw attention to yourself while under the effects of the ritual, nearby creatures still do not become aware of you, though they will take notice of whatever is disrupted and react normally to that.

Anyone concealed by the ritual's magic that attacks or interacts with a creature to which he is veiled automatically ends all its effects on himself only. In addition, the disorientation caused by the breaking of the magical forces concealing him disrupts his actions and momentarily confuse him. Just before performing any attack or interaction with a creature to which he is imperceptible, the ritual's effects end and cause him to lose any actions (thus losing a surprise action) and impose a -4 penalty to his next Initiative check. As such, this ritual is not very effective in helping parties to sneak up on enemies; only to bypass them unnoticed.

If there are a number of different types of creatures in a party that you are trying to avoid with this ritual, you may cast it multiple times before choosing to have it take effect. This allows you to choose multiple types of creatures in an enemy group before a previous casting of the ritual expires. However, should you not choose a particular creature type in the enemy group to bypass, that creature may make normal attempts to perceive you. If that enemy does detect you, it may make its companions aware of danger. Those creatures still will not notice you, however, unless you attack or interact with them, as noted above. As such, you could deal with just those creatures that are aware of your presence, and still manage to steal away from the others, if you act quickly enough.

After five minutes or by the time the party triggers another subsequent encounter (whichever occurs first), the magic of the ritual fades and all affected are again normally perceptible.

In preparation for an oration, diplomatic endeavor, or performance, you cast this ritual and harness certain magical energies to aid you in your effort. The magic of the ritual embellishes your performance with visual, auditory, and emotional delusions that cause spectators to revel in your performance. These effects can be as subtle or spectacular as you desire.

Upon completing the ritual, make an Arcana or Religion check. The result of your skill check determines the bonus to any skill checks you make that are part of the performance observed by others (i.e., it does not affect Insight skill checks you make to determine if someone is lying to you during the course of your performance). Your Arcana or Religion check also dictates how many spectators are influenced by your performance. If more individuals observe your performance than you can affect, or are outside of the area you can affect, only those closest to you within the area are affected. For anyone outside of your area of influence or who are otherwise not affected by this ritual, you simply do not gain the benefits of the bonus it imparts.

You cannot make creatures invisible with this ritual, and any item affected immediately becomes visible if it is removed from the ritual's zone

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Object Size	Area Affected
19 or lower	1 Tiny object	Close blast 1
20-24	1 Small object	Close blast 1
25-29	1 Medium or 4 Tiny objects	Close blast 1
30-34	Any or all objects	Close blast 2
35-39	Any or all objects	Close blast 5
40 or higher	Any or all objects	Close blast 10&lt;/table&gt;

Your Arcana check +5 determines the Stealth DC of the invisible objects. A creature entering a square containing a tiny object gains a +5 bonus on its Perception check (including passive Perception) to notice that object. A creature entering a square containing a size Small or large object automatically detects that object.

You prepare an especially treacherous ritual that you can unleash at any time within the next 24 hours. Should you become subject to any binding ritual within that time, you can alter its wording and effects ever-so-subtly to create a loophole through which you can escape its influence. 

At any time you are affected, influenced, or controlled by a binding ritual, you may choose to make a single saving throw. If you are successful, you are free from any and all of the ritual's effects, though you may choose not to make others aware of that fact. You gain a bonus to your saving throw based upon the result of your Arcana check.

If your saving throw fails, you are affected by the Binding ritual normally.

You can determine a time when the alignment of the heavens will benefit the performance of an important task in a specified location. By beginning a specific activity at an astrologically determined inception, you can avoid bad luck or even ensure good luck on the task being performed. The task to benefit from this ritual and the location in which it will be performed must be chosen at the beginning of the ritual. If either the place or the task changes, the ritual must be re-cast to have any benefit.

Based on your Arcana check, you can avoid bad luck or gain a bonus to rolls involved in the named task provided it is performed at the specified time and place. These bonuses may apply to a single skill or ability check, a series of related rolls, or a single skill challenge depending on the task specified, but never to attack or damage rolls.

You can use star charts in conjunction with knowledge of the time and place of an individual's birth to divine a wide variety of information about him or her. Unfortunately, there are several limitations to this information. If the time and place of the individual's birth are incorrect, then the information provided by a birth horoscope will be similarly inaccurate. Furthermore, while the heavens heavily influence most people, they do not rule any individual completely. The more detailed the information that a birth horoscope provides the more likely it is that a few of those details are not entirely accurate in spite of the influence of the celestial bodies.

The exact information provided by this ritual depends on your Arcana check. A higher check provides the listed result as well as the information gained for lower check results.

You reveal to yourself the details of the opponents in the next three encounters (as determined by the DM), their locations, and their strengths as long as they are within 50 squares of your location. If there are any traps within 20 squares of your location, you know their positions and their lethality. If you are in a dungeon, you can map out a radius of the next 20 squares.

Upon completing the ritual, you immediately glimpse everything between you and the farthest visible point from you in a direction of your choosing. From a good vantage point and with normal visibility, you may assume that you can see up to any point within a day's journey by foot. Because of the width of humanoid creatures' line of sight and the magical properties of this ritual, you may assume that you can see an area that is equally as wide as it is long. (In game terms, this means that the effective area is a blast with sides whose length is determined by how far you can see in the chosen direction.) Any number of factors such as obstacles, weather, and terrain may impede your vision and therefore limit what you can see.

In any case, you briefly get a magically enhanced view of everything between you and the farthest point you can see. You may make an immediate Perception check with a +10 bonus to notice anything that may lie in that area. Whatever you notice at that time may or may not still be there when you arrive at the point where you saw it.

Use this ritual to prepare your party for an upcoming battle. As the ritual begins, choose a specific group of enemies you expect to encounter within the next day (for example, gnolls). As you pray to the gods, you are granted insight into your enemies' weaknesses, and you share these revelations with those who participate in the ritual with you through an inspired sermon. During any encounter within the next day with the specified type of group of enemies, you and up to five of your companions who participate in the ritual can call upon this inspiration to gain a number of benefits. You see the chinks in your opponents' armor, you find you can predict their every thrust and parry, and you move to thwart any advantage they try to seize upon before they can capitalize upon it.

This ritual grants you a certain number of combat-related bonuses against attacks from the chosen enemies. Upon completion of this ritual, make a Religion check. The result of your Religion check determines the bonuses you gain and what they affect. You gain all bonuses associated with your check result and all lower results.

With this awesomely powerful (and excruciatingly intrusive) ritual, you can open the mind of a creature to your own to be read like a book. Because you must carefully and patiently probe your subject's thoughts, make careful arcane gestures and manipulate the subject physically to literally coax its thoughts to the surface of its mind where you can tap them, you must have a willing or helpless subject to perform this ritual. A creature that is unwilling to succumb to the ritual and who struggles will disrupt your ability to sustain your link with its mind. Attempting this ritual on a subject who is not helpless always fails within 1d6 x 10 minutes, ruins half the component cost, and wastes 2 of the caster's healing surges. Likewise, if the subject dies before the completion of the ritual, those components and healing surges are lost.

Upon completion of the ritual, you may freely access the creature's mind, knowing anything it knows or feels from its emotional state to its memories to information it knows to dreams it has had. You needn't know the creature's language, for in exploring its mind you discover information not in language but in thoughts. Your own mind translates those thoughts into information you can comprehend just as easily as the target can. However, there is a limit on the type of information you can learn with this ritual, and you must know what you are looking for as you carefully sift through the vast expanse of all that the target knows.

With this ritual, you can discover factual information (of information the target believes to be factual) of almost any sort. Simply framing a question in your mind allows you to sift through its thoughts and discover the answer (as your subject perceives it). This does not guarantee you will gain correct information, only information the subject believes to be correct. You may ask one such question of the subject and immediately know its answer each round that you are able to sustain the ritual. You cannot simply open the creature's mind and assume you know everything it knows and store it for later. Nor can you learn the creature's language, skills, feats, or powers (or any other such ability the subject possesses) with this ritual.

Upon completion of the ritual, make an Arcana check. Use the result of your Arcana skill check plus10 as an attack roll vs. the creature's Will defense. If the result of your Arcana check equals or exceeds the subject's Will defense, the ritual is successful and you probe into its mind, gather whatever information you choose. If the modified result of the check is less than the subject's will defense score, you complete the ritual, expend the component costs and healing surges, but fail to probe its mind and learn nothing from it. The result of your Arcana skill check without the +10 bonus also serves to determine how long you can sustain the link into the creature's mind. For each round of its duration, you learn one piece of information from the subject.

20-24	2 rounds

You put a willing or helpless target into a light trance, the better to focus its mental energies and greatly increase its powers of recall. Most creatures simply don't have the mental discipline and awareness to utilize the full power of their memory and subconscious, but you assist the process by means of this ritual.

The target is under the trance for approximately 10 minutes. During this time, you may ask the target questions, which it answers truthfully and to the best of its ability. The exact quality of information you receive, however, depends on your Arcana check as determined below. You must make an Arcana check each time you ask a question. Although questioning the target might be simple and straightforward when fully cognizant, the trance requires you to phrase your questions slowly, and the target may have to think about the answer for a moment before responding. These factors limit the practical amount of questioning that can be done, but careful questioning can still be highly effective.

The information you can retrieve is limited by what the target has been personally exposed to. Questioning a peasant, for example, is unlikely to give you any insight into the affairs of a powerful wizard. You can, however, retrieve information that the target might not consider significant on a conscious level.

You may ask up to five questions when you cast this ritual. Depending on how well you roll, you might be able to ask further questions (if you desire to do so).

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Information Received

21-25	Insightful information ("The Duchess wore the gown, the silver tiara, and a gold ring with an emerald. I don't know where she got the ring, but her husband didn't give it to her.") You may ask one follow-up question relevant to the answer ("How do you know that the Duke didn't give her the ring?")
26 or higher	Highly detailed information, including insights the target is not consciously aware of ("I never saw the duchess wear that ring until Margrave Ballaki spent the night in the castle last summer.

With access to charts showing the positions of the stars, moon, and planets at different times throughout the year, you can predict the weather and other natural events occurring in a specific time and place chosen at the beginning of the ritual.

The exact information provided by this ritual depends on your Arcana check. A higher check provides the listed result as well as the information gained for lower check results.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana or Nature Check Result	Information Gained
9 or lower	The most prominent feature of the weather ( "rain", "snow" or "hurricane")
10-19	Additional details about the weather (3 feet of snow in 7 hours)
20-29	Secondary features of the weather ("with light winds" or "plus fog")
30-39	Complete information as if described to you by someone who was present 
40 or higher	Complete information on the weather and natural events as if you could experience it first hand&lt;/table&gt;

Focus: 
Performing this ritual requires a star chart worth at least 100 gp as a focus.

You place a drop of a subject's blood into a pool of water. One after another, images of the subject's ancestors appear as if reflected on the surface of the water. With each image a voice can be heard to whisper the name of the person displayed. When you begin the ritual you may choose what language the voice will speak in, but it must be a language that you understand. The order in which the images are displayed starts with the subject's parents and continues backwards in generation. The number of generations the ritual displays is dependent on the result of your Arcana check.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Generation
9 or lower	Parents
10-19	Grandparents
20-29	Great-grandparents
30-39	Great-Great-grandparents
40 or higher	One additional generation&lt;/table&gt; 

This ritual may instead be used to confirm the blood relation of two subjects. At the casting of the ritual, a drop of each subject's blood must be placed into the pool of water. If the two subjects are related, their images will be displayed and a voice will whisper their relation. An Arcana check is not required for this use of the ritual.

The ritual's component cost represents salts, dusts, and solutions that are dissolved into a body of water. Once the ritual has begun, any object that pierces the surface of the water disrupts the ritual, ruining the results.

Pierce the Veil allows you to recognize effects as illusory and resist powers with the illusion key word. Further, at any point during the duration of the ritual you may make a single Wisdom vs. Will attack against an invisible creature within 20 squares as a minor action. You must be aware of the creature to make this attack, but you needn't pinpoint it exactly. If the creature is in range and the attack hits, the creature is no longer invisible to you. If it uses another power to become invisible, however, you cannot use this attack again.

Upon completing the ritual, make an Arcana check. The result of your Arcana check determines the bonus you gain when making Insight checks to recognize effects as illusory, your bonus to Will defense against powers with the illusion keyword, and your bonus to saves made to end illusory effects on you caused by powers with the Illusion keyword.

Originally developed to appease denizens of the wild, this ritual was found to be capable of contacting other types of beings by substituting components. Each time you perform this ritual, select and use only one type of components from the table below. That choice determines the origin of the beings you can contact at that time. When you perform this ritual, you can limit its scope to specific types if you wish. (You could choose to contact only fey humanoids instead of all fey or only natural magical beasts instead of all natural creatures.)

&lt;table&gt;Components Used	Origin of Beings Contacted Ruling Skill
Alchemical Reagents	Fey or elemental	Arcana
Rare Herbs	Natural	Nature
Sanctified Incense	Immortal or shadow	Religion
Residuum	Any (including aberrant)	Arcana, Nature, or Religion (choose one)&lt;/table&gt;

Depending on the components you use, this ritual announces your presence to beings of the chosen type(s) anywhere in the nearby vicinity (within 100 squares of you), and tells them of your desire to learn what to do to serve their interests, while not severely damaging your own.

If there are no beings of the type you chose to contact within range, you learn that fact.

If there are such beings in range, but they are unwilling to be contacted in this manner, you learn that fact and nothing more. (If they resent or fear this kind of intrusivemagicalinterrogation, you would only be able to contact them by other means.)

If the beings you seek are willing to be contacted, images appear in your mind showing what those beings would like you to believe they want, including any special conditions or time limits. If you will, you may try to accomplish their desires. If you succeed, those beings' dispositions might improve (though obdurate ones could always remain spiteful).

You can see all things around you as they once were. A castle in ruins is restored to the splendor of its prime; a forest ravaged by flames is lush and vibrant once again; shattered fragments of clay and stone are the masterfully worked sculpture an ancient artist once created. All things are whole again in your sight, and you can see the creatures that dwelt there long ago, the trappings of their culture, their accoutrements, and anything else that lingered there when it was thriving.

This ritual only works in places that have been destroyed or fallen into disrepair, but works regardless of how much time has passed since the place was thriving. You see the area as it was when it was still thriving, and you see every detail of what was there at that time. You cannot hear as a result of Remembrance of Wholeness. The ritual does not impart the ability to understand what you are seeing, nor to interact with the things you see. If an ancient scroll you see is in an unknown text, you cannot read it, and if it is locked away in a bone scroll tube, you cannot get to it. The time at which you see things and in exactly what state they appear to you is determined by the fates that grant you the Remembrance of Wholeness, and throughout the duration of the ritual events continue unfold as they did at the time you see them. Creatures move around and go about their business as they did long ago. As such, you may or may not glimpse certain individuals or things that were in the area when it was thriving, as they may simply have been absent at the particular time you see. (The DM's discretion will dictate exactly what you see.)

Upon completion of the ritual, make a skill check. If you seek to be granted remembrance of a man-made structure, make an Arcana check. For a holy site of or place of religious significance, make a Religion check. For an area of wilderness, make a Nature check. The result of the check determines how long your special sight persists.

As you cast this ritual, make a Religion check. The result of the check determines how quickly an extraplanar force hears and answers your plea for knowledge. At the end of this casting time (the end of your turn in the round in which the casting ends), you immediately obtain your answer (if the resulting Arcana or History check is successful).

If your Religion check results in a time that is longer than you wish to wait, you can abandon the ritual. Unless your question is answered immediately (because your Religion check result is 40 or above), you lose only one round's worth of actions (that is all actions in the round in which you began the casting). Because you can immediately sense the lack of the mystic vibrations that indicate that an entity intends to answer your plea, you lose only that single round if you choose to abandon it. Further, you stop before expending all of the required components and save half the cost.

Because your plea is so urgent, and because you are calling upon whatever forces are willing to hear you, this ritual carries with it the inherent risk of drawing the attentions of a malignant entity. In addition, a sacrifice of vital energy (healing surges) is required for such a speedy answer. In all other respects, the ritual functions the same as the Consult Mystic Sages ritual (see 4E Player's Handbook).

You contact the dead spirit of an intelligent creature whose name is known to you, to ask questions and receive answers. At the DM's option the spirit may manifest as an apparition or simply communicate with the ritualists mentally. The spirit knows only what it knew in life and what it has experienced in the afterlife, though most spirits refuse to talk about the latter. Your familiarity with the target and the result of your Arcana or Religion check determines the number of questions the spirit will answer.

This ritual requires at least one assistant to aid the caster. Everyone participating in the ritual must join hands in a circle. Should this circle be broken at any point during the ritual, either by force or by one of the members breaking physical contact or leaving the circle, the ritual immediately ends.

You sit in a meditative trance that transports your soul into the primal spirit world. You can still see and hear things in the plane your body is on, but you see things as though a thick fog and all sound and smells become less distinct (-5 to all Perception checks).

While in the spirit realm, one or more animal spirits appears to you as larger and more intelligent members of their species. You can seek out a spirit of the specific variety of animal of your choice and ask it a number of questions based on your Nature skill check. This roll is modified by any personal relationship you may have with related animals or animal spirits. At the DM's option you may be able to seek out a specific individual animal spirit whose name is known to you.

Each animal spirit is mainly knowledgeable about their spiritual and mundane animal brethren as well as their activities and anything happening within the borders of their natural habitat. This ritual conveys the ability to communicate freely with the spirit animal regardless of the caster's languages or ability to speak with animals.

While in the spirit world, you become vulnerable to attack by unfriendly animal spirits. In the spirit world you retain all of your normal statistics, but you cannot take any of your physical possessions with you, and must fight unarmed or flee from the spirit world and back into your body (thereby ending the ritual). Common animal spirits in the spirit world will have combat statistics equivalent to their mundane animal counterparts, though some may be far more powerful.

This ritual allows you to make a Religion check against the target's Will defense. If you hit, you know what deity the target worships. The symbol of the target's deity appears over its heart as a faintly glowing outline visible to you and up to 8 allies you choose to include when casting this ritual. These allies can see what you see, but they cannot assist the caster in the Religion check to determine the target's loyalties. You may still need to make another Religion check to correctly identify the target's deity.

If you don't hit, you do not know what deity the creature worships. You see a murky gray blob of energy over the target's heart. However, if the target proclaims allegiance to a given deity or temple while the ritual is still in effect, you may make another Religion check against the target's Will defense each time it makes such a statement.

Whatever the case, as you complete the ritual, choose either the Diplomacy or Bluff skill, and make an Arcana or Religion check. Your skill check represents how many individuals' feelings within the masses you tap into and how keenly you grasp the swirling ether that is their will. During the next day, you can apply a bonus to checks with the skill you chose and the Insight skill. You may use this bonus when dealing with a certain number of people based upon your skill check result.

This versatile ritual is performed before your next skill check or the next skill check of an ally. It involves an offering to a relevant deity in accord with a specific task about to be undertaken. The ceremony thus completed, the recipient gains a +1 to +5 bonus to the applicable check depending upon your Arcana or Religion check. If the recipient ever performs a skill check different from the one intended by the ritual in the meantime, he doesn't get any advantage, the bonus staying in check until he carries out the planned task. 

As an example, a trap must be disabled. The party's cleric accomplishes the formal procedure, obtains a Religion check of 17, and simply touches the rogue upon completion. The rogue gains a +3 bonus to her Thievery check when she disables the trap.

The ritual's components are the four aces of a common deck of cards, along with either a king or queen figure, depending if the recipient of the ceremonial is a man or a woman. In addition, objects or tools germane to the task at hand and worth no less than 25 gp are required. The cards and articles all fade away at the ritual's conclusion.

The following list, which is far from exhaustive, gives only some possible examples.

This ritual alters a contiguous area into one type of terrain (difficult, blocking, challenging, hindering, obscured, or cover) chosen by the caster. The caster is free to choose the specific terrain - uneven ground, shallow water, walls, impassable rubble, ice, deep mud, lava, pits, fog, smoke, piles of rubble, and so on - as long as it's appropriate to the specific environment in which the ritual is cast. An Arcana or Nature check determines the maximum number of contiguous squares of terrain you can alter. The first number shown below is the maximum squares of blocking, obscured, or cover terrain. The second number is the maximum squares of difficult, challenging, or hindering terrain.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana or Nature Check Result	Maximum Number of Squares Altered
19 or lower	3/5
20-29	6/10

To complete this ritual, the caster must spend 10 minutes preparing components and casting the ritual. Then, at any time within 24 hours, the caster spends a minor action; this is when the contiguous area of terrain is chosen.

When beginning the Ancient's Chant, name another ritual. By emptying your mind with this chant, you are able to focus upon casting the named ritual.

The casting time and cost of the Ancient's Chant varies, based upon the ritual you intend to cast next. The casting time is equal to that of the named ritual. The casting cost includes 35 gp worth of components, plus a number of healing surges equal to half the level of the named ritual. Your allies cannot assist you by contributing healing surges (although they may assist you with your skill check).

Once you have determined the casting time and cost of this ritual, make an Arcana or Religion check. Use the result as a bonus to any skill check you make when casting the named ritual. You lose the benefit of Ancient's Chant if you do not cast the named ritual immediately afterwards, or if you are interrupted while casting the named ritual.

You target a non-hostile Tiny animal, usually a raven, spider, or ferret. The animal must remain within 5 squares of you for the time necessary to perform the ritual. Once the ritual is complete, the animal always occupies the same square you do, staying with you until its service is discharged.

Once per encounter, you can command the Animal Decoy to distract one adjacent enemy during combat as a free action, providing you with a bonus to one Bluff check to gain combat advantage. Your Arcana or Nature check determines the benefits provided by the Animal Decoy and how long it remains with you.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Bluff Check Bonus	Duration
19 or lower	+2 bonus to Bluff check roll to gain combat advantage	2 hours (1 encounter)

40 or higher	+5 bonus to Bluff check roll to gain combat advantage;	Bluff check is now a free action in combat instead of a standard action 8 hours (4 encounters)&lt;/table&gt;

After the animal performs this service for you or the ritual's duration ends, your influence ends, and the animal reverts to its natural behavior. You can have only one Animal Decoy with you at any one time; any attempt to bind another Animal Decoy results in the subsequent ritual's failure (though ritual components will still be expended).

While using wildshape to take the form of an animal, you use this ritual to tie yourself even closer to that animal. This ritual allows you take on more animal traits of the animal, such as movement rates, though these abilities only last as long as you remain in this animal form. 

There are five categories of animals that you may select from: aquatic, bird, burrowing, predator, or primal. You must wildshape into an appropriate animal before casting the ritual, and this ritual lasts as long as you maintain that wildshape form. This ritual ends as soon as you resume your humanoid form, use wildshape to change into a different animal form, or use an atwill, encounter, or daily power without the beast form keyword. If this ritual ends while you are in a dangerous environment, such as in mid-flight if you are using the bird version of this ritual, you suffer the effects of the environment normally.

The abilities granted by this ritual depend on your animal form and your Nature check result.

20-39	Swim 4, low-light vision

Using your knowledge of the natural world, you can attune a lodestone to any single object or place in the world. Items or locations on other planes cannot be found with this ritual. You must have some knowledge of the object or place you wish to find and succeed on a Nature check to attune your lodestone to it. Once attuned, the lodestone points unerringly toward the object or place when set on the ground. The lodestone always finds the shortest path, even if that path is impassible.

By summoning your arcane power, you can animate a single object of no more than Medium size to perform a simple repeatable task (such as digging or sweeping). Upon completion of the ritual, the object needs precise instructions on what it is to do. These instructions must be a simple command (like "sweep", "dig", or "push") and the amount of time you wish the object to perform the task. After the command is given, the item works until either its task is completed or the ritual's duration ends. If required to use an Athletics or Endurance check, the item uses your Arcana modifier instead. This ritual must be performed on an appropriate object for the task to be done (you cannot animate a sword for digging or a rope for pushing).

This ritual heightens your awareness of the subtle body language of your allies. For the duration of the ritual, you and your allies can communicate simple tactical messages to each other with hand and body gestures. The only requirement is line of sight from sender to any other ritual participants, and the message is automatically understood. Each message must be a simple statement, conveying a single action you are going to perform or a single action you wish an ally (or allies) to make. All gestures are free actions. The number of gestures you can make in a single round is determined by your Arcana check. The benefits from this ritual apply only to simple tactical actions. Using subtle signals with social interactions and other situations are resolved normally.	

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Signaled Actions/Round
9 or lower	1
10-29	2

This ritual affects you and up to five other willing participants. This ritual makes it difficult for other combatants to notice or understand the non-verbal gestures being made around them. Anyone not included in the ritual takes a -10 penalty to Perception checks to notice the gestures, and a -20 to Insight checks to understand them.

You place a small, invisible beacon on an object that allows you to know the location of that object merely by concentrating on it. This act of concentration requires a standard action. The beacon can be detected by an Arcana check, which must beat the Arcana check of the ritual caster who placed the beacon. How much information you receive from the beacon, as well as its duration, is based on your Arcana check.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Location of the Object	Duration
19 or lower	Direction only, i.e. North	24 hours
20-39	Direction and approximate distance, i.e. less than 25 miles to the North	1 week
40 or higher	Direction and exact distance	1 month&lt;/table&gt; 

The beacon, once placed, can lay dormant indefinitely - a dormant beacon is almost impossible to detect, raising the DC to do so by 10. Once activated by a free action, the above durations take effect.

There is no limit to the distance over which you are able to activate a beacon, but it must be on the same plane as you or the beacon will give incorrect information.

Every time you concentrate on the beacon, anyone trained in Arcana near the object gets a free Arcana check to notice the beacon's magical signal.

You may not have more than one beacon at a time; if another beacon is cast, the original one fades away.

The Transfer Enchantment ritual may be used to move the beacon to a different object, while the Disenchant Magic Item ritual may be used to destroy only the beacon itself, leaving the other properties of the object intact. In both cases, the level of the beacon's ritual caster is used instead of the level of the magic object to determine if the ritual caster is able to affect it. For instance, a level 15 magic item with a beacon on it cast by a level 8 ritual caster would be treated as a level 8 magic item for the purpose of the Disenchant Magic Item ritual being used solely to remove the beacon.

The sacrifices must be living creatures that are bound, drugged, unconscious, or otherwise unable to defend themselves. In order to successfully sacrifice a victim, the caster must spend a full-round action and succeed on a DC 20 Arcana or Religion check. A failed check means that the ritual sacrifice has been botched and the caster gains no benefit from that individual's death.

This ritual enables you to understand communications from a creature with an origin other than Natural, and who is not using a spoken language to communicate. For the ritual to be effective, you must have witnessed the method of communication in the last 24 hours. Such methods of communication include body language, simple vocalizations, instinctual understanding, or methods that defy classification.

If the result of your Arcana check is 35 or higher, you are able to dialogue with entities that know this method of communication, instead of just understanding them. You become able to actually use the actual method of communication only if it is physically possible; if it is not physically possible, you can still communicate by speaking a language you know. Your message will be mystically understood by the entity with which you are communicating. That said; most non-spoken languages will either be much simpler or much more complex than spoken ones. Therefore, the message you send might be simplified or seem fragmentary, even bizarre; and vice-versa. You might be unable to express certain advanced concepts or you may be faced with the perplexing task of sorting through a thousand new forms of expressing what you thought to be a simple emotion. However, the loss of some understanding is still far preferable to being shredded apart by a creature from another plane.

    <Flavor> A good mage is always prepared - even prepared to be caught off guard. Using an esoteric technique, the spellcaster goes through the entirety of his or her ritual casting, adding complex gestures and flourishes. And nothing happens. It is not a fluke. With a knowing smile, the spellcaster knows he can call upon the power of a ritual at any time, with but a few simple gestures. A good mage always prepares in advance, after all. </Flavor>

You pick a ritual that you are capable of casting, and begin to cast it as normal. Near the end of your casting, you alter the weave and flow of magic, building up a flow of mystic energy, but channeling it within yourself to hold until needed. Your casting time is doubled when storing a ritual in this manner, and the normal gp component cost for the ritual is 25% higher than normal, rounded up. For example, if a spellcaster wishes to use Contingent Ritual with the Animal Messenger ritual, the casting time becomes 20 minutes, rather than 10, and the component cost is 13 gold, instead of 10 gp. 

Having channeled a Contingent ritual, the caster can later trigger the ritual with a standard action. For rituals that involve skill checks, the caster makes the skill check at the time the ritual is triggered, not at the casting of Continent Ritual.

The limit to how many rituals can be held in Contingent Ritual is determined by an Arcana check performed before the first Contingent Ritual casting of the day. The check determines the total number that can be held in reserve for that day, and if the caster fails to meet the minimum DC for the check, he or she is unable to use Contingent Ritual that day. Further, the check also determines the highest level of ritual that can be held in reserve. Rituals higher than 20th level cannot be held with Contingent Ritual.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Maximum Number of Rituals Held in Reserve	Highest level of Ritual
19 or lower	1	5th
20-29	2	10th
30-39	3	15th
40 or higher	4	20th&lt;/table&gt;

Spellcasters typically use Contingent Ritual to prepare rituals they will need at some point during the day, based on their research into the situation at hand. For example, a ritual user who knows they will be traveling to a foreign country where the natives speak a language unfamiliar to the party may cast the Comprehend Languages ritual and place it in reserve. When the party encounters the natives for the first time, the ritual user can use Comprehend Languages, as he has now "heard" the language, a requirement for the Comprehend Languages ritual.

Once you complete the ritual, you are empowered with the ability to create tiny fields of invisibility with your touch. As a standard action, you can touch a solid, inanimate object (usually a door) and a circular area just beyond your fingertip becomes invisible, allowing you to peer through the object, and view what lies beyond. About the circumference of a gold piece, the area of invisibility extends through the object. Your Arcana check determines how many times you are able to use this ability before the ritual expires, as well as determining the depth of the invisibility through the object. This ability only works on non-magical, non-living, solid materials like wood, iron, or stone. Mostly used on doors, this ritual's effects can also be used on containers like chests and locked cabinets, but without a way to see into darkness, little information as to what is inside such objects is revealed. The area of invisibility provides only one-way perception. Creatures on the other side of the object do not notice the newly formed 'peephole.' The information revealed to the viewer through the invisible peephole is limited by its small circumference, the depth of the door or object, and the lighting conditions beyond.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Depth of Invisibility	Charges
19 or lower	2 inches (simple wooden door)	2
20-29	4 inches (usual stone door)	4
30-39	6 inches (main door to dungeon complex)	6
40 or higher	12 inches (protected vault door)	8&lt;/table&gt; 

The charges last until expended or until the caster takes an extended rest. The areas of invisibility last for 1 minute. If used on an invalid object, like a magically warded door, that particular casting fails but a charge is not expended. If the object is too thick to see through, a charge is still expended, and the caster can see through the object to the depth specified by the Arcana check.

You draw upon your knowledge of the natural world, greatly increasing your own or an ally's sense of smell. This provides a bonus to Perception checks made to spot or search, as well as to find tracks. It may also provide information not immediately apparent, such as the lingering scent of a fragrant cigar that passed through the area or the smell of burning leaves some miles distant. Your sense of taste is also greatly enriched, revealing deep wells of flavor in even common rations and in rare wines an exquisite sensory pleasure. 

&lt;table&gt;Nature Check Result	Perception Bonus
19 or lower	+2
20-39	+4
40 or higher	+6&lt;/table&gt; 

Because a dog's sense of smell is over a hundred thousand times as sensitive as a humanoid's, any creature not used to the increased stimuli while under the effect of this ritual is prone to being distracted. The comparison would be if someone blind all their life suddenly recovered their eyesight-wanting to look at everything would not be an unusual reaction. This is subject to the DM's judgment, but might include a slight penalty to social interactions as new smells reveal themselves and the creature involuntarily inhales deeply through its nose.

Casting this ritual after a failed Perception check allows another check to be made, as the circumstances have changed sufficiently.

In addition and at the GM's discretion, if this song is played in the presence of the specific dragon color the caster chose, and it is not inherently hostile because of previous events, it will not attack the caster or his allies. Unless it is attacked, it will instead listen attentively while the ritual is being performed. For the purposes of making Stealth checks, the dragon is considered distracted while the song is being played.

When you perform this ritual you cause a creature of your choice to fall into a deep slumber. Although you need not know or have ever seen the subject, when performing the ritual you must describe your intended target with enough clarity that the ritual unequivocally knows which creature you're talking about.

If your description is insufficient to determine a specific creature, the ritual fails and no components are expended. If your statement describes a target other than the one you intended, the ritual still functions and the components are expended. You only know if the ritual was successful, not if it affected your intended target.

Your Arcana check is used as an attack roll against the target's Will defense, success indicating the creature falls asleep for a number of hours as determined on the chart below. If you fail to beat the target's Will defense, the ritual fails and the components are expended. Your Arcana check also determines the ritual's range. If no creature within range matches your description at the time of casting, the ritual fails and no components are expended.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Range	Duration of Sleep
19 or lower	1 mile	2 hours
20-29	5 miles	4 hours
30-39	20 miles	8 hours
40 or higher	100 miles	12 hours&lt;/table&gt;

Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as Magic Circle, can block Enchanted Slumber. Only damage can revive the sleeper. Loud noises and rough handling are insufficient to break the ritual's effect. The sleep is restorative, and grants the creature the benefits of an extended rest if it sleeps for at least six hours.

You enchant one or more weapons so that the damage they deal is of a specific energy type. Each time you use this ritual, you determine the type of energy damage the affected weapon or weapons deal. If you used the Arcana skill you can choose from acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. If you used Religion, you can choose from fire, necrotic, or radiant. Attacks with the weapon gain the keyword associated with the damage type. For example, if you enchant a weapon to deal fire damage, attacks made with it gain the fire keyword.

The ritual lasts for a number of encounters determined by your Arcana or Religion check. You can divide the duration between up to three weapons (depending on your Arcana check), but each weapon must last for at least one encounter.

You enchant a furnace or cooking fire so that it never runs out of fuel. You begin the ritual by building a mundane fire inside a ring of runes drawn in chalk. Alchemical reagents are added to the flame in stages, causing violent reactions. The completed ritual creates an oddly colored flame that continues burning long after it has exhausted its supply of fuel. The fire smolders like a pile of hot coals unless someone utters a command word to change the intensity of the blaze. Command words are set at the time of casting. The most common command words are "bigger" and "smaller" spoken in Dwarven.

You draw upon the positive energies of the universe to imbue yourself or another creature with the ability to greatly increase your momentary surges of physical and psychic vigor. While in effect, this ritual allows temporary hit points you gain to stack with each other, up to a certain limit, depending on your Religion check.

&lt;table&gt;Religion Check Result	Level of Power Gained
19 or lower	Ritual caster's Level + 5
20-29	Ritual caster's Level + 10
30-39	Ritual caster's Level + 20
40 or higher	Ritual caster's Level + 30&lt;/table&gt;

The ritual does not grant you temporary hit points, only the ability to benefit from multiple sources of such hit points. The temporary hit points disappear if you take a short or extended rest, but the ritual still remains in effect if its duration has not ended, allowing you to gain its benefits the next time you gain temporary hit points.

The ritual causes you to greatly exceed you normal limits. When the ritual ends, you lose all temporary hit points you have at the time. If you do not make a successful saving throw at the ritual's conclusion, you also become weakened until you reach your next milestone or you take an extended rest.

You bend the fabric of space and time to create an extradimensional pocket that contains a set of stables large enough to accommodate up to six Large creatures, three Huge creatures, or one Gargantuan creature. From the inside of this extradimensional space, it looks just like any earthy stable; but from the outside, it is invisible unless the portal is open. The stable comes pre-stocked with straw bedding and grain for common domestic animals used as mounts (horses, mules, donkeys, etc.). The stable is staffed by an invisible servant (treat as an invisible 1st-level minion with no attacks, all 10's in ability scores, and +5 Nature) who cannot leave the extradimensional space of the stables. This servant will have the mounts rested, fed, and groomed within an hour's time.

The extra-dimensional stable is accessible by a stationary portal which can only be opened and closed by the caster. Provided that the caster closes the mounts in the stables before leaving, the stables provide a safe haven for the mounts of the caster and his allies. To get the mounts back, the caster need only return to the place the portal to the extradimensional stables was originally opened, and he can cause the portal to reappear at will. The extradimensional stables disappear after the mounts and all other living beings have been removed from them.

You draw an extraplanar trader and businessman to your location for a deal. You may buy a wide selection of mundane items and any magic item of the specified level or lower from the trader (as determined by your DM). The trader will buy any magical or mundane item from you as well. The total amount the trader is willing to purchase and the maximum level of magic item for sale are determined by your Arcana check.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Maximum Item Level	Maximum Purchase
19 or lower	Your level	Maximum item value
20-24	Your level +1	1.5 times maximum item value
25-29	Your level +2	Twice maximum item value
30 or higher	Your level +3	Three times maximum item value&lt;/table&gt;

The trader is typically an efreet or other powerful extraplanar being, and arrives with bodyguards. A trader will not appear in a town or settlement, nor will it come if there are any obvious potential threats in the area. The trader will not fight for the summoner, take the summoner with it, or provide any other services except for buying and selling equipment. If attacked, the trader disappears back into the planes. Efforts to bind the trader with other magic or magically charm or compel it automatically fail.

An extraplanar trader does not always arrive immediately after the completion of the ritual; sometimes there is a wait of a few minutes to a few hours. If the summoner has recently performed this ritual, or has mistreated previous extraplanar traders, it is possible that no trader arrives at all. In such cases, the component cost is not expended.

You create a translucent bubble that forms around you (a close burst) and anyone in close contact with you. The size of the bubble is under your control and the larger it is, the more lift it provides. The maximum amount of lift and the bubble's AC is determined by your Arcana check result.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Maximum Load	AC	Bubble Size
19 or lower	250 lbs.	10	Burst 1
20-29	500 lbs.	15	Burst 3
30-39	1,000 lbs.	20	Burst 5
40 or higher	2,000 lbs.	30	Burst 8&lt;/table&gt;

If successfully attacked, the bubble fails and the contents of the bubble fall from their current height. The bubble's pilot can make a saving throw modified by his or her Dexterity modifier to reduce the falling damage by one half. The pilot's saving throw applies to all occupants, who can then further reduce the falling damage if they are trained in Acrobatics.

The bubble does not provide any additional protection to its occupants, and they are considered to be immobilized. Occupants cannot make attacks from within the bubble without causing it to fail, but they can move in and out of it with a move action. A successful attack on the occupants is also a successful attack on the bubble.

The pilot can only control the upward and downward motion of the bubble, which is at the mercy of the winds for direction. The maximum rate of ascent and descent is 2 squares per round.

The bubble can float on and below water holding up to 2,000 pounds, regardless of Arcana check result. The AC determines the depth possible: 10 feet per point of AC. Air inside the bubble lasts for 10 hours divided by the number of Medium-sized creatures within the bubble. The movement of the bubble is at the mercy of prevailing currents in whatever medium it is traveling (air, water, etc.)

The ritual requires a clear gem that is consumed as the bubble is formed.

You create a zone of calm in an area burst 3 within 5 squares where you and your group can rest and refit. This calm supersedes almost any normal surroundings or situations. The ritual reduces loud noises, dims bright lights, sweetens noxious odors, and moderates normal temperatures to a maximum of 20 degrees. Magical effects or extreme temperatures are not affected. The quality of rest is so good it reduces the amount of time needed for an extended rest. 

Extremely talented wizards can evoke such a peaceful rest that temporary hit points are gained at the end. Recipients of Ferriandus' Peaceful Rest must be in the zone for the whole extended rest to benefit from the temporary hit point bonus.

The zone does not prevent nor warn of the entrance of creatures into the zone.

The reduced extended rest time and possible temporary hit points are determined by you Arcana check.

When this ritual is cast, the affected surface area of a natural cavern or tunnel, as determined by the caster's Arcana check result, is transformed into smooth, finished material of the same original type it was comprised off. This gives the area a more finished appearance and can be used for doing the finishing work on a roughly dug out tunnel or for quickly finishing the surfaces of an underground passage if necessary. The size of the opening in any direction cannot be extended by more than it would take to smooth out the surface so, for example, a tunnel roughly 5 feet in diameter can be transformed into a finished 5 foot high by 5 foot wide passage, but cannot be transformed into a 5 foot wide by 10 foot high space.

After tracing an obscure seven-pointed star on the ground and placing a candle at each point, chanting this ritual allows you and up to six others to walk on fire, ignoring all ill effects.

This ritual protects you and any willing creatures from being damaged by walking over lava or through flames. The participants are also protected from extreme heat up to the temperature of molten lava (around 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit). Your possessions are likewise protected from any damage that might come from being exposed to the extreme heat, though if an item is dropped into lava, the ritual does not extend to protect it.

This ritual only protects against ambient heat; there is no benefit against magical fire directed at any of the affected creatures, for instance.

The ritual's component cost is 1,000 gp, and in order to receive the benefit of it, a creature must stand in the star and spend at least one healing surge upon the ritual's completion. For each healing surge spent, the ritual will protect that creature for one hour.

After the appropriate amount of time, the ritual and all protections it grants end.

You cause a building or complex of buildings and the ground on which they stand to rise into the air. If several buildings are to be affected, they must be surrounded by a wall or otherwise joined. The buildings must all fall into an area no larger than 30 squares by 30 squares and 100 feet (20 squares) in height.

The castle will float at a height which you command, either staying in one location or moving at a maximum overland speed of 12 squares. Your creation may be permanently floating, or capable of descending to earth.

When the ritual is cast, you must either specify who can magically command the structure to move, or create physical controls to be used for piloting. At the DM's discretion, your castle may also sail on the winds or be drawn by flying creatures.

Anyone within the affected building or buildings at the time of the ritual immediately becomes aware of what is happening. Those trained in the Arcana skill then have the opportunity to make an Arcana check of their own. If this beats the caster's Arcana Check Result, the ritual fails and no components are expended.

At the DM's discretion, there may be further restrictions on the size and movement of the castle, as well as the conditions for casting the ritual.

You must remain in the zone or the storm weakens. For each round that you are outside the zone, the duration and modifier decreases by one category. This ritual can only be used outdoors. Also, the roiling cloud mass is noticeable from a considerable distance unless the current weather hides the effects.

This ritual must be performed by a minimum of two characters, but no more than five including you. The component cost for this ritual is 500 gp per participant, and each participant must spend two healing surges. 

At the end of the ritual, each participant may choose a power from his or her own class (the action type and level of the power is dependent on the result of your skill check). The participant does not need to know the power, but it must be one the character is capable of learning (multiclass characters can choose from either class). Each character then bestows the chosen power on another character who participated in the ritual. No character can have more than one power bestowed upon him or her in this manner.

Each player may use the power bestowed upon him or her only once, if the power is not used within the duration of the ritual, it is lost. When using a bestowed power, the character using the power must meet all prerequisites, requirements, or other restrictions.

You draw upon arcane forces and attempt to erase all signs of your presence from the immediate area. The area of effect is based on the result of your Arcana check. Your Arcana check, with a +5 bonus, also sets the DC for Perception checks made to detect your presence.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Area of Effect

This ritual does not interact directly with living or dead creatures. For example, if the ritual was performed on the site of a recent battle, spilled blood would disappear, broken twigs would be repaired, footprints and other obvious signs of battle would be erased, but a dead body would remain where it fell. It is important to note that this ritual attempts to restore an area to what it looked like prior to your presence and activity there, including the presence of up to ten others you may choose to include in the ritual when casting it. This means that performing the ritual on the site of a battle you did not participate in would not restore it to its pre-battle condition.

If the area of effect is given in miles, this indicates the number of miles that have 'forgotten' your presence. If you are currently being pursued, then whatever trails you may have left end abruptly. The ritual is not perfect, however. Those creatures pursuing you are still entitled to a Perception check.

A successful Perception check indicates that some small trace remains, unnoticed by you, which provides a sign of your presence and activities in the area. Only one Perception check can be made per creature.

You enchant your home, be it a town home, villa, keep, tower, tree house, or dungeon, to provide several conveniences, such as: 

* Doors that open and close by themselves.
* Mundane locks.
* Fireplaces and hallway sconces that light themselves.
* Chairs, serving dishes, brooms, and other domestic items that move about by themselves.
* A harmless sensory effect such as a shower of sparks, trees made of glass, ceilings that mimic the sky above, faint music, etc.

Nothing that you create with this ritual can deal damage, serve as a weapon, or hinder another creature's actions in any arcane way. The size of the mansion affected by this ritual is roughly a burst defined by a number of squares equal to 25 + your Arcana skill check. The number of effects that your manse may exhibit is based on your Arcana check as well. While you are within your manse, you may direct these effects from anywhere inside your manse. Each direction of an effect takes a minor action.

This ritual allows you to create hundreds of little feet that appear from the base of the target object, like a chest, statue or even a boat. These feet allow the object to move at a speed of 4 squares per round (200 feet per minute and 2 miles per hour). The object follows you or someone you designate, at a distance you specify, up to a maximum of 10 squares. It can be given simple commands; for example, "travel north," and will follow them until the duration expires to the best of its ability.

Your Arcana check determines the maximum size of an object you can move. If the target object is larger that this maximum, you cannot move it and you lose half the component costs.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Maximum Size of Object	Component Cost (gp)
9 or lower	Small	125
10-19	Medium	300
20-29	Large	700
30-39	Huge	1,600
40 or higher	Gargantuan	5,000&lt;/table&gt;

If the target object is secured, or restrained, the Little Feet struggle in an attempt to dislodge themselves from their surroundings. The weight of the target object does not impact the speed of the feet. However, the surface that the object walks on must be able to support its weight. For example, a statue animated by the ritual may be too heavy to transport over a rope bridge. You may also have difficulties with clearance for the animated object; a tall obelisk will not fit through small doorways or through low tunnels.

Food, drink, exotic scents and smokes fill the perceived space, as do opulent furnishings which offer the greatest comfort to any ally who reclines on them. The ritual provides food, shelter and rest in the wilderness, but it appears as if you are sleeping on the ground to anyone not affected by the ritual. You can dismiss the ritual with a minor action. Any attack immediately dismisses the ritual.

If you or an ally takes an extended rest within the duration of the ritual, regain the value of all healing surges spent, until your next extended rest, increased by +1.

This ritual allows you to seed an area with a meme - a catchy idea that expresses itself in every facet of society for a brief time. The meme appears as a design etched on goods, as doodles in the margins of books, graffiti on walls, as a topic of conversation... it is inescapable. The area covered is dependent upon your tier.

&lt;table&gt;Tier	Coverage
Heroic	A town, or district of a larger city
Paragon	A city, or a portion of a larger country
Epic	A country&lt;/table&gt;

This ritual only takes effect in civilized areas such as villages and towns, since it depends upon the presence of thinking creatures to manifest and propagate. The actual casting of the ritual is brief (five minutes) but it takes a full hour for the effects to appear.

Apart from the ability to seed an idea across a wide area, this ritual also allows you to embed a message within the meme that can only be deciphered by a single person named by you during the casting. Upon first coming across the meme the target immediately and instinctively understands the message you embedded within it.

The complexity of the embedded message and the duration that the meme persists for is dependent upon your Arcana check.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Duration	Complexity
19 or lower	1 hour	10 words
20-29	6 hours	20 words
30-39	24 hours	30 words
40 or higher	1 week	40 words&lt;/table&gt;

Memes may persist long beyond their original duration, depending on the whims of society. However, their forced ubiquity and magical message fade when the duration expires. After that they are just interesting designs or catchphrases.

You attune yourself to any one weapon in your possession, and infuse it with elemental power.

For the duration of the ritual, you may take a -2 penalty attack and damage rolls to any martial attack power or basic attack in order to deal that type of damage rather than normal damage. In addition, any critical hit dealt with the weapon deals ongoing 5 of that type of damage.

Anyone else who attempts to use the weapon suffers a -3 penalty to attack rolls. Any other type of elemental damage that you would deal with other items or powers instead becomes the type chosen for the ritual.

You may only cast this ritual for yourself, and the weapon will be attuned only to you. You can end the effects of the ritual at any time. You may not be under the effects of more than one Mystic's Devotion at once.

This potent ritual causes fantastic or magical terrain to return to a more natural state, causing cave slime to vanish off walls and transforming blood rock into normal rock. Illusory walls are destroyed and land polluted or fouled by magic rejuvenated. This ritual may not affect certain magical or fantastic terrain at your DM's discretion. The ritual does not affect difficult, blocking, or hazardous terrain unless it is fantastic or magical in nature. 

The effects of this ritual are instantaneous but not necessarily permanent. Therefore, while you could cause choke frost in an area to disappear, choke frost in surrounding areas may eventually fill in the gap.

The area affected by Natural State is determined by an Arcana or Nature check.

You tap into the essence of a creature from the natural world and confer its vocal characteristics to you and your allies. For the duration of the ritual, you and your allies are able to speak to each other using the same vocal characteristics of the animal chosen. You hear the growls, grunts, chirps, or clicks of the chosen animal coming from your allies, but you understand them as if they were speaking your native language. Anyone not included in the ritual only hears basic animal sounds and will not be able to understand what is being spoken. Even if a creature can understand the sounds from the base animal (like the base creature itself ), it will still be unable to understand the communication between the ritual participants; it is a magical effect using the vocal characteristics, not duplicating a language.

The sounds created must still be audible to the recipients; this ritual does not grant extraordinary hearing to the participants. Within these parameters, you can use this new method of speaking just as you would your normal language; you can whisper, yell, or sing just like you could with normal speech. You can still use your usual, normal voice and normal languages as you wish, even mixing them just as easily as you could mix words of any dialect you know within the same sentence. Your Nature check determines the duration of the ritual's effects.

You rip a small hole in the fabric of reality, opening a window to a fiery realm in the Elemental Chaos. This tiny hole is much too small to move through, though it does give off the amount of heat and light a strong fire would. The flames will not cross over the edge of the opening, though their heat could certainly melt snow and ice that is close enough to be affected by it. Because the source of heat is a window to another plane, it could be opened in situations where a normal fire could not exist, such as in heavy rain or under water. 

Your Arcana check determines the maximum duration of the effect.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Duration
14 or lower	1 hour
15-19	2 hours

You can choose to close the window at any time, provided you are within sight of it. This requires a minor action.

When the window closes, any benefit of heat disappears.

While the opening is too small for you to travel through, it may attract creatures from the Elemental Chaos. The longer the window is open, the greater the likelihood a creature from the Elemental Chaos may investigate.

You rip a small hole in the fabric of reality, opening a window a watery realm in the Elemental Chaos. This tiny hole is much too small to move through, though it does release a steady trickle of fresh water, enough to fill a bucket in about a minute if held underneath the opening. Continuous water may have an erosive effect on the ground, and if there is not a sufficient drainage system, it will begin to fill an enclosed chamber. 

Water that enters particularly cold areas will freeze after leaving the opening, but the force of movement from the Elemental Chaos prevents the actual opening from being frozen shut.

When you cast this ritual, you force water to part before you and expose the land beneath. The exposed ground is 2 squares wide and must extend in a straight line from a point no more than 3 squares away from you. Your Nature check determines the volume of water you can affect, and the ritual's duration.

&lt;table&gt;Nature Check Result	Depth/Distance	Duration
19 or lower	10 feet/10 squares	10 minutes
20-29	20 feet/20 squares	30 minutes
30-39	40 feet/40 squares	2 hours
40 or higher	80 feet/80 squares	4 hours&lt;/table&gt;

If the water is too deep for you to reach the bottom, the ritual fails and the components are expended. The ritual must also connect two areas of dry land for it to succeed. For example, if you try to part a lake 80 squares across, but only roll a 30 on your Arcana check the ritual fails and the components are expended. You do not create a dry path 60 squares into the lake that ends in a wall of water.

Flowing water, such as in a river is interrupted, but does not build up the way it would behind a dam. The water crosses the intervening space without moving through the affected area. Creatures and objects in the water or floating on it follow the same route.

The caster may end the ritual's effects as a minor action.

You prepare a chamber by drawing a unique permanent magic circle on its ceiling using a specially prepared paint mixed with exotic dyes and powdered metals. The prepared chamber remains potent until the permanent magic circle is disrupted or removed. Multiple chambers, with their own unique design, may be prepared with each casting specifying a single destination.

In the future you may draw a 10-foot diameter circle with the specially prepared paint. Placing any non-living objects on the circle and completing the ritual results in them falling through the floor and out from the ceiling of the prepared chamber. The effect only lasts for a fraction of a round.

The temporary teleportation circle is burned in the process and must be recreated at a further cost of 30 gp for any future casting. Only inanimate objects may be teleported, although non-animate corpses are acceptable, and once sent, they cannot be retrieved again by means of this ritual. The destination chamber must be on the same plane as the sending circle and each chamber design must be unique. If more than one identical chamber exists, the items will not be delivered.

Care should be taken with any delicate items, as the fall and impact may damage them.

A prepared chamber should be kept from prying eyes as the design painted on its ceiling may be disrupted and recreated elsewhere. If an enterprising thief accomplishes this feat, any items sent will be delivered to the thief's chamber rather than the legitimate original. A good amount of booty may be lost before the scam is discovered; however, not all deliveries may be welcomed by the thief.

This ritual conjures a Medium-sized figure that resembles a typical human adventurer. The Phantom Explorer moves ahead of you setting off any traps, hazards, or ambushes that might be lying in wait. The Phantom Explorer weighs exactly 100 pounds and is treated as a living creature for any effect it is exposed to. The Phantom Explorer has no hit points and does not avoid any attacks directed against it. As soon as the Phantom Explorer takes any damage or suffers from any condition, it is destroyed, and the trap, hazard, or ambush is probably revealed for what it is.

You can cause the Phantom Explorer to move anywhere from 1 to 10 squares ahead of you, moving at a speed equal to your base land speed. You can direct it to manipulate any object that you have line of sight to, including opening a chest or pulling on a lever. It cannot fight and has no intelligence, and can only move or manipulate objects when commanded to do so by you. Directing a Phantom Explorer to take a particular course of action (even changing how far ahead it moves from you) requires a minor action. 

A Phantom Explorer can be recognized for what it is with a successful Insight check with a DC equal to your Arcana check, meaning that some creatures may not be fooled by it.

This simple and cheap, but rather tedious ritual allows you to sustain certain other rituals by essentially causing their durations to begin again once you complete it. It even allows you to restart the duration of a ritual which you did not, or even could not (due to your level), perform. Indeed, this ritual is most often performed by apprentices and acolytes in order to sustain rituals originally brought into being by their more experienced elders, who usually have better things to do with their time and resources.

You may only restart rituals that affect or influence an area. You must be within the area affected by the ritual you seek to renew when performing the Reset ritual. The ritual you sustain continues to function in all ways as if performed by its originator. You can use this ritual repeatedly to sustain a ritual so long as its duration never actually elapses before you finish it. In theory this means you could sustain even very powerful rituals almost indefinitely.

Since it takes four hours to perform this ritual, it is typically used to restart rituals with relatively lengthy durations, most often an entire day. This permits a temple, wizard college, or similar institution to sustain rituals originally performed by their more powerful members without placing too high a burden on their daily schedule. All it requires is that one or more junior members give of their own time to sustain the ritual. As you might suspect, performing this ritual is a common punishment for students who displease their teachers.

This ritual creates a temporary structure intended to serve as a spiritual chapel for those religious characters who find themselves displaced from more traditional places of worship.

The structure created is 2 squares by 2 squares with a single door. There is a sign on the door that can be flipped to indicate if the chapel is "available" or "occupied." The sign is magical and cannot be removed from the door. The words appear in whatever primary language the reader is familiar with. For illiterate characters, the sign will display a pictogram indicating a "yes" or "no" for admittance.

Inside the chapel, which is dimly lit by a soft, magical glow, there is a small alter with a simple prayer rug lying on the ground before it. There are also several small candles, matches, a large loaf of warm bread, and a large basin of clean water. The materials inside (except for the candles and matches) are non-flammable. Although the ritual caster may enter and leave the sanctuary without restriction, other individuals may only enter and exit the sanctuary once per day. Up to four Medium-sized or one Large-sized creature may occupy the interior of the sanctuary.

The candles and matches are intended for religious purposes. The water can be used for religious purposes (it is holy water), for cleaning, or to satisfy one's thirst. The bread may also be used as part of a religious ceremony if desired, or simply consumed.

Other items may be left in the chapel for use by others who enter it. Any additional items left inside at the expiration of the ritual's duration appear on the ground where the sanctuary previously stood.

The walls of the sanctuary have a magical dampening effect on sound such that it is impossible to hear anything happening outside the sanctuary from the inside, with the reverse being true as well. The closed door is considered an iron door for purposes of breaking in, and the walls are considered to be hewn stone.

The casting of this ritual requires a designated sacrificial victim who must be present for the entire casting time. At the culmination of the ritual, you make a coup de grace attack against this victim. If you cannot make a coup de grace attack against the victim (such as if he is not helpless) you may make a melee basic attack instead. If the victim dies as a result, the ritual succeeds. A failed ritual still uses its normal value in components but grants no benefits.

Upon success, you gain one of the following benefits chosen at the completion of the ritual:

* The effects of one of the victim's feats.
* Skill training in one of the skills the victim was trained in.
* A single piece of knowledge - a word, a phrase, the answer to a single question - that the victim possessed.

The first two benefits last for only 24 hours before fading. For the duration of the ritual, the caster gains all the benefits of the feat or skill training as if he had selected it himself. Knowledge gained through the use of this ritual is permanent, although it may be forgotten normally.

Calling up a horde of insects beyond counting, this ritual blankets the lands in locusts, weevils, beetles, and all manner of harmful insects. This ritual affects a 2 mile radius, within which, all normal plants are eaten within 8 hours and creatures with the plant keyword suffer ongoing 1 damage as long as they are in the affected area (no save). All creatures in the affected area suffer a -5 penalty to Perception checks and cannot regain healing surges. Any target more than 5 squares away is considered to have concealment. The insects cannot be killed with normal attacks in any quantity sufficient to make a dent in their population.

By channeling ancient nature spirits through your body, you exert your control over the very weather. Your Nature check determines the potency of the ritual. Once your result is determined, you can freely choose the severity of the storm you desire - just because you are entitled to make a tornado, for instance, does not mean you have to spend four healing surges and do so.

&lt;table&gt;Nature Check Result	Strength and Cost	Duration
19 or lower	Heavy rain/1 healing surge	2 hours per level
20-29	Lightning storm/2 healing surges	1 hour per level
30-39	Torrential downpour/3 healing surges	30 minutes per level
40 or higher	Tornado/4 healing surges	1 hour&lt;/table&gt;

The storm initially appears around you, and then travels to wherever you direct it before taking its final form. It can be directed anywhere within your line of sight. Depending on the temperature, the type of precipitation may be sleet or snow. 

This ritual will not create rain clouds indoors.

The potential effects of storms are up to the DM. Heavy rains may cause dirt to become mud, hindering movement and erasing tracks, for example, while a lightning storm may result in trees being struck and falling down. A torrential downpour might well lead to flash flooding, while a tornado would be an incredibly destructive force, leaving rubble, broken buildings, and widows in its wake.

The area affected by a storm can be no larger than a city, and may be as specific as a particular block. Once directed, you do not have any further control over how the storm behaves. It would be almost impossible to have a tornado affect only a specific part of a city, for example.

While this ritual is most often used to create severe storms, it could also be used to clear away such weather. If the current storm is the result of a creature having used this ritual, then the DC to break up the storm is the Nature check result of the first caster. If successful, the storm dissipates within 10 minutes.

Any creature that aids you with your Nature check must also spend a healing surge, as the ritual is extremely strenuous.

You are able to locate and tap into the supernatural power that flows through particular places in order to empower a consecutively cast ritual.

Magic is the lifeblood of the land. It ebbs and flows across the landscape, but in some special locations it collects into pools of supernatural power waiting to be tapped. The streams of magical energy that crisscross the land are called ley lines, and the places where these ley lines meet and magical energy pools in larger quantities are called power nexuses. To a casual observer, a power nexus appears as a place of great natural beauty, but those with the Ritual Caster feat can feel the magical energy in the air. Particularly potent power nexuses are sometimes marked with an obelisk, pyramid, or standing stones and are almost always guarded by those who do not wish to share its power.

In order to cast this ritual, you must locate and travel to a power nexus. Finding a ley line or minor nexus may only require a journey of a few miles, but locating and accessing a more potent power nexus may be the focus of an entire adventure or campaign arc. You must be within 10 squares of a nexus to be able to use this ritual. The result of your Nature or Arcana check determines the maximum magnitude of power nexus you are able to access and the bonus it provides. This bonus applies to the next ritual you cast, provided that you begin it on the round after you complete the Tap Power Nexus ritual. Higher magnitude power nexuses are more difficult to tap but provide greater magical energy. On a failed check, you are unable to re-attempt to tap the supernatural energy of that power nexus for 24 hours.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana or Nature Check Result	Maximum Magnitude of Power Nexus Tapped	Bonus to Consecutively Cast Ritual
9 or lower	Ley Line	+2

This ritual allows you to create an area where most creatures produce glowing footprints that not only make it simple to track them, but which also reveal critical pieces of information about them. Your Arcana or Religion check determines the size of the area affected by Telltale Trail, which is a burst.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana or Religion Check Result	Affected Area
9 or lower	Burst 5
10-19	Burst 10
20-29	Burst 20
30-39	Burst 40
40 or higher	Burst 100&lt;/table&gt;

A creature that moves over any horizontal surface within the area of the ritual leaves a bright, glowing footprint behind. This print persists for the next 6 hours as it slowly fades away. While it exists, you, as well as anyone whom you spend one minute teaching the secret, can learn the following information about the creature that made the print merely by looking at it:

* Alignment
* Origin
* Type
* Approximate level (heroic, paragon, or epic)

Examining a print is a minor action. The exact color and shade that reveals a particular piece of information about a given creature changes every time you perform this ritual. This means you must teach others how to read a footprint again whenever you perform the ritual. Once you teach someone the secrets of interpreting a footprint, he or she can teach it to others as well.

Any creature able to see a set of footprints can track down the creature that made them, so long as it stays within effect of the ritual, without the need to make a Perception check.

This ritual places a portion of your soul into a tree and vice versa, linking your two life-forces together. As long as the tree remains healthy, your body shares the resilience of the tree you are bound to. You age as the tree does, slowing your natural aging rate to 1/10th of its normal value. Druids who use this ritual tend to become slower in action and more considerate in their thought processes, taking on aspects of the trees. Some have even been known to grow moss in their hair and beards after using this ritual.

While under the effects of this ritual, you may cast the Hibernation ritual (see pg. 82) once per day without consuming components. You may cast the Tree Stride ritual once per week without components and ignore the limitation of line of sight, but you may only travel back to your bound tree. You also gain a +5 bonus to Endurance checks to resist disease and a +5 power bonus to death saving throws. Twice per day, as a free action, you can regain an expended healing surge while adjacent to your bound tree. The bound tree may be used as a body part for purposes of the Raise Dead ritual, and doing so ignores the normal 30 day limitation of that ritual.

If the tree you are bound to is damaged, you immediately suffer the same amount and type of damage. If the tree is killed, you die as well. This ritual ends if the tree is slain, even if you somehow survive or are returned to life.

This ritual allows you to find a single body as long as it is on the same plane as you are. For the duration of this ritual, you can determine the general direction of the body but not determine distance. You can also use your Religion check whenever a skill check or skill challenge calls for you to use Perception to find clues or notice details about the body in question.

If the body has been dismembered, the ritual directs you to the nearest piece of the body of significant size (hand-sized or larger). If the body has been utterly destroyed (such as by immersion in acid, disintegrate, cremation, and so on), this ritual directs you to the place where the remains were destroyed.

This ritual is capable of pointing you to deceased bodies and undead creatures. If used on a person that is still alive, you learn that they are still alive and the ritual fails. You must have a personal effect of your target for this ritual to work: a bit of hair, a piece of jewelry, a garment or something similar from the person you wish to find.

This ritual can only be performed at night. The effects last until sunrise.

You create a special magical link between two willing living recipients. The creatures must be within 10 squares of each other when the ritual is cast, but do not need line of sight to one another (they still must have line of effect). The recipients must each hold a magical focus that links them together when the ritual is cast, but these don't need to be kept beyond the ritual's completion. Once the link is established, the two creatures remained linked until the link is somehow broken.

While joined by the magical link, the recipients share all resistances, immunities (save for the insubstantial quality), and saving throw bonuses, whether granted by magical items, class, or race. For example, if a dwarf and an eladrin were linked with this ritual, the dwarf would gain the eladrin's +5 bonus to saving throws against charm effects; and the eladrin would gain the dwarf's +5 bonus to saving throws against poison. The creatures are still counted as separate entities with regards to defenses, hit points, and being targeted by powers or affected by conditions; though, if one creature gains resistance or immunity to a particular effect, both recipients benefit from it.

Resistances, immunities, and saving throw bonuses do not stack. Instead, the creature with the higher bonus counts first (immunity to an effect is always greater than resistance to the same effect).

The link crosses any distance, but is instantly severed should one of the recipients travel to another plane or die. Certain magical effects or wards such as an area of dead magic or petrification might also sever the link at the DM's discretion.

Focus: 
The foci for this ritual are two flawless gemstones of the same type and size worth at least 5,000 gp each.

This ritual creates a magical bond between its participants, giving them the ability to better function as a team in hostile environments. Once the ritual is complete, the participants (up to five total) gain the ability to converse with each other via whispers - words whispered by one participant can be heard easily by any other designated participant as long as they are within the area of effect of the ritual. Note that magical silence effects still block this communication.

In addition, depending upon the key skill used to cast this ritual, one (and only one) of the following effects is granted to all participants:

* Arcana: They each gain the ability to communicate with each other purely by mental thought.
* Nature: They each know the distance and direction to each other.
* Religion: They each know when any other participant is first wounded, bloodied or affected by a condition (stunned, dazed, immobilized, etc.)

Note that the information conveyed by this ritual works for participants who are all within 1 mile of each other and on the same plane, though the ritual will still be in effect should the wayward participant in question return within range of the ritual.

You baptize a single worshiper of your god with elements sacred to your religion (animal blood, ash, iron shavings, light, plant extracts, wind, sand, salt, smoke or water, etc.). The target baptized may spend a healing surge at the end of this ritual. He or she may use this healing surge normally, or, instead of healing damage, the target can use it to gain an immediate saving throw, with a +5 bonus, to end any of the following conditions: blinded, cursed, dazed, deafened, slowed, stunned, or weakened.

This ritual binds two creatures together so their life forces are shared, allowing them to feel each other's wounds and heal each other's injuries. This ritual may only be used on two targets that are willing or helpless, and may only be used on creatures that have healing surges. Each of the two targets must expend a healing surge as part of the ritual casting, and cannot recover this healing surge until the ritual ends.

While this ritual is active and both targets are within 10 squares of one another, they can draw upon each other's healing surges as if they were their own, but when doing so, use their own healing surge value. Also, either target can spend a healing surge as a free action to transfer one ongoing effect from the other target to itself. The downside of this ritual is that if one of the affected creatures dies, the other takes damage equal to the dead creature's healing surge value.

The duration of this ritual depends on your Arcana or Religion check result.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana or Religion Check Result	Duration
19 or lower	1 hour
20-29	4 hours
30-39	8 hours

This ritual creates an emergency reserve of healing that will be activated under specific circumstances. When this ritual is cast, you must set a specific situation that will activate the ritual; if that situation occurs, the target of this ritual spends two healing surge as an immediate reaction, regaining the appropriate amount of hit points. The most common situations used with this ritual are when the target becomes bloodied, when the target reaches 0 hit points, when the target suffers ongoing damage, or when the target suffers some sort of status effect.

When this ritual is cast, the target must spend a number of healing surges determined by the Heal check result. The target gains no hit points from spending these healing surges. Regardless of the number of healing surges spent in the casting of this ritual, the target only gains the benefit from two healing surges when the ritual activates.

&lt;table&gt;Heal Check Result	Healing Surges
19 or lower	3 healing surges
20-39	2 healing surges

Drawing forth disease, drought, hunger, and misery, this ritual improves the quality of life for those in the affected area. In a 2 mile radius, fields are fertile, rains plentiful, and the people happy. Creatures in this area gain a +2 bonus to Endurance, Heal, and Nature checks and a +2 bonus to death saving throws for the duration of the ritual as long as they remain in the affected area. Any crops or livestock will be especially productive and profitable for the time the ritual is active.

Casting this ritual in the Shadow Realm inflicts a -10 penalty to your Nature check result, while casting it in the Fey Realm grants a +10 bonus to your Nature check result. This ritual will negate a Storm of Insects ritual if cast in the same area.

This ritual involves the target drinking a foul tasting concoction of herbs and minerals for several nights straight under the new moon. Known only to a few werewolf hunters, alchemists, and nomads, it is rarely used since the smallest mistake can awake the lycanthrope influence to attack those who try to cure it.

The target of this ritual must be willing or helpless for the duration of the ritual. During the ritual, each night the target drinks the concoction, and the ritualist most make a Heal check. The Heal check result determines the effectiveness of that night's concoction.

&lt;table&gt;Heal Check Result	Effectiveness
9 or lower	Failure, and the target turns into his lycanthrope form and attacks the ritualist if able
10-19	Failure
20-29	Success, and the target suffers damage equal half the Heal check
30 or higher	Two successes, and the target suffers damage equal to the Heal check&lt;/table&gt;

You must accumulate 5 successes within the week after the new moon. If you cannot accumulate enough successes, you must start again on the next new moon, including buying all the ritual components again. If you do accumulate 5 successes, the creature loses its lycanthrope powers and shapechanger origin, becoming a normal member of its race and gaining the natural origin.

This ritual has no effect on shifters, though they do find the concoction involved incredibly vile.

Focus: 
The focus for this ritual is a sprig of wolfsbane and 1 pound of silver.

This ritual allows you to detect an abnormal ailment affecting a single target. The target must remain immobile for the duration of the casting time, but does not need to be a willing participant. Your Arcana check determines if there is an ailment on the target, and possibly the type and severity of the ailment. The ritual defines an ailment as something outside the normal occurrence for that body type, such as a curse, disease, or ongoing effect. This ritual reveals all ailments upon the target. The ritual does not reveal how to cure any ailments found.

To complete this ritual you must have a relatively complete corpse of a creature that died less than 24 hours ago. You infuse the body with necrotic energy and arcane reagents, returning the body to a semblance of life. Any temporary conditions that had been applied to the subject creature are no longer in effect; however, permanent conditions still apply.

The subject returns to life with 1 hit point and no healing surges. For each healing surge you (or others assisting with the ritual) expend as part of the component cost, the subject begins with additional hit points equal to the surge value, up to its maximum hit points. The subject creature cannot gain or expend healing surges, but it can benefit from healing powers that do not require it to expend surges. Every 8 hours, the subject creature must make a saving throw or lose hit points equal to its level. If reduced to 0 hit points by any means, the subject immediately dies.

The subject is also affected by a death penalty (see the Raise Dead ritual in the 4E Player's Handbook). Unlike Raise Dead, the death penalty applied to a creature under the affect of False Life does not fade. In addition, the subject is dazed and the only actions it can use are at-will powers.

Also, like Raise Dead, you can't grant False Life to a creature that has been petrified or has died of old age. In addition, the subject's soul must be free and willing (see Raise Dead for more information). The component cost increases to 1,000 gp for paragon tier characters and 10,000 gp for epic tier characters.

Time spent under the affect of False Life counts toward the time the subject can be dead and still be affected by Raise Dead or a similar ritual (including another casting of False Life). A creature under the affect of False Life can still be raised as an undead creature, in which case, the False Life ends immediately.

A tool of necromancers of the worst sort and the more intelligent varieties of undead, this ritual allows you to heal yourself by consuming the corpses of others. This unwholesome ritual is commonly used by powerful undead after battles in order to quickly prepare for future attacks. This ritual can be performed by the living, but even most necromancers draw the line at cannibalism.

The corpses consumed as part of the ritual must be of Small size or larger, have an Intelligence or Wisdom score of at least 5, and be of the natural, fey, or immortal origin. These corpses must have been killed in the last 24 hours and must retain at least half their mass.

The number of corpses the ritual caster must consume and the effects bestowed by such cannibalism varies according to your Arcana or Religion check result; if there are insufficient corpses, the effect is the highest possible for the number of corpses that are available. You can only benefit from this ritual once in 24 hours. You do not actually consume the entire corpse, instead consuming choice bits, such as the heart, liver, or brain.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana or Religion Check Result	Corpses Required	Effect

This ritual allows you to remove a fragment of a willing or helpless target's soul, allowing the target to avoid many of the limitations of the Raise Dead ritual. This ritual places a shard of the target's soul in a specially prepared gemstone worth at least 20,000 gp. The loss of the soul shard forces the target to lose a healing surge that cannot be regained until the soul shard is returned to the target. The gem containing the soul shard may be used as if it were a body part for the Raise Dead ritual and ignores the 30 day limit normally associated with Raise Dead. If the gem is put in contact with the corpse of the target, it will restore the target to life as per the Raise Dead ritual, though no component cost is paid. Either method of using the gem to return the target to life restores the soul shard to the target and shatters the gem. 

The target of this ritual cannot pass onto any sort of afterlife as long as the gem containing its soul survives, even if it dies of old age or by other means Raise Dead cannot remedy. If the gem is destroyed, the soul shard returns to the target immediately without harm to the target.

Focus:

You restore the youth of one creature, returning the subject to its physical prime. All conditions related to age end, but other permanent conditions or injuries remain. For example, blindness caused by extreme age is instantly removed by this ritual, while blindness caused by injury or a power remains.

Your Heal check determines how long the renewed youth lasts.

19 or lower	6 months
20-29	1 year
30-39	5 years
40 or higher	10 years&lt;/table&gt;

The subject of this ritual ages normally while under its effects. After this ritual ends, the subject rapidly returns to its correct physical age. If the subject has exceeded the normal lifespan of its race through this ritual, then it dies when the ritual expires. If the subject repeats this ritual, the durations stack, but the subject's physical age does not change further.

Optional Focus: 
The duration of the ritual can be made permanent through ritual sacrifice. This requires a sentient creature, willing or unwilling, who loses a number of years of its life equal to the years being restored. If more years are needed than the victim has left, then multiple victims may be required. In addition to the sacrifice, special oils and components worth 25,000 gp are also required.

Creatures don't actually take an extended rest, however, and so keep benefits such as accumulated action points.

You cast the ritual on yourself and up to five willing recipients. The ritual speeds up time for those affected. The group takes a short rest. That short rest becomes and extended rest for all rules applying to short and extended rests. The extended rest is 8 hours long, though only 5 minutes pass in the rest of the plane. Because the fabric of the universe is fragile at this point in space, your group may not move more than 1 square in any direction from where the ritual was cast, nor can they do anything other than talk to each other. Any attempt to move beyond the distance stated or use any powers (regardless of their intent), dispels the time compression instantly for everyone involved. Neither you nor any other members affected may cast any other rituals for the same reason. If the compression is stopped prematurely, the duration does not count as an extended rest, only a short rest.

Because of the bizarre laws of time and space, you cannot use this ritual more than once in a true 24-hour period.

When you perform this ritual, designate a specific arrow as your focus. Once fired from a bow, that arrow functions as a magical sensor allowing you to see as if you were standing where the focus was. Until activated, the dweomered arrow retains its charge for 3 days.

Your arcana check determines the effective duration of the scrying sensor once the arrow is activated.

You can see through the sensor but you cannot hear; if you have darkvision or low-light vision, it functions through the sensor. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.

Warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, cannot block the ritual. However, the arrow takes on a dweomered shimmer that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. If the target of this ritual notices your scrying sensor, the target can simply spend a standard action to destroy the sensor.

This ritual creates a scrying sensor - a shimmer in the air - that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. If the target of this ritual notices the aura, the target can use a standard action to focus its will in an attempt to destroy the sensor. Make an opposed Wisdom check, aided by your allies; if the target's result is higher than yours, the sensor is destroyed and you spend one healing surge but regain no hit points (or take damage equal to your healing surge value if you don't have any healing surges left). The subject can repeat this effort until the sensor is destroyed or the duration ends.

You and your allies can hear through the sensor as well as see, and if you have darkvision low light vision, it functions through the sensor. You and you allies can use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.

When you perform this ritual, you create a small, egg-like orb of absolute darkness. To activate the egg, spend a healing surge and choose a square within 20 squares of you. You do not need to have line of effect to the square. You create a magical sensor in that square. You can see and hear as if you were standing there, and you have darkvision through the sensor. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor. 

Your Religion check determines how long the sensor lasts. The Egg may be activated as many times in an hour as the caster has healing surges to spend.

19 or lower	1 round

The ritual creates a scrying sensor - a dark aura - that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. If the sensor is noticed, you can take a standard action and spend another healing surge through the Egg to create a burst of necrotic energy centered on the square that holds the sensor. You create a burst 2 attack, using your Religion check result against each target's Fortitude defense. On a hit, the target suffers necrotic damage equal to your Religion check result minus 20. Making this attack destroys the sensor and the Egg.

Sufficiently powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, can block the Egg of the Coot. If the location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components.

The focus for this ritual is the Egg of the Coot itself. Within its black depths you see and hear what the focus coveys.

Use that deck in any game of cards where gambling occurs, and for the duration of the ritual, one item valuing at least 50 gp functions as a magical sensor allowing you to see and hear as if you were standing where the focus was. Typically, the caster of Emit's Plaques of Far Sight purposefully loses the item to the person he wishes to scry.

You have no inherent way to discern where the sensor is in relation to you, but careful observation might give you some clues. The sensor moves with the subject for the duration of the effect.

When you perform this ritual, designate a specific coin as your focus. For the duration of the ritual, the coin functions as a magical sensor allowing you to see and hear as if you were standing where the focus is.

Unlike most scrying rituals, you have an innate sense of where the focus is; this sense allows you to determine the general direction of the focus, but not proximity. Careful observation through the scrying sensor might give you some clues as to the focus' actual location.

Your Arcana check determines the effective distance of the ritual. Once the focus passes beyond this radius, the ritual is broken.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Effective Distance
19 or lower	20 squares
20-24	1 mile
25-29	10 miles
30-39	100 miles
40 or higher	1,000 miles&lt;/table&gt;

You can hear through the sensor as well as see (note that most coins are placed in a pouch or treasure chest); if you have darkvision or low-light vision, it functions through the sensor. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.

Warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, cannot block the ritual. However, the coin takes on a dweomered shimmer that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. If the target of this ritual notices your scrying sensor, the target can simply spend a standard action to destroy the sensor.

When you perform this ritual, you must be within a natural forest or woodland. Choose a creature with the natural or fey origin to scry; if that creature is within the woodland, you create a magical sensor adjacent to it, and you can see and hear as if you were standing in the square where your sensor is located.

You need not personally know or have ever seen the subject. Nor does it need to be a specific creature (although it must be of the fey or natural origin). "The nearest ogre," or "the goblin warchief," suffices. The magic of the ritual interprets your statement of intended subject in the most straightforward way possible. If no creature matches the description, the ritual fails and no components are expended. When faced with multiple potential creatures to scry, the ritual defaults to the closest one.

You can discern a sensor's general direction and distance. The location of the sensor is static; once established (by locating the creature to observe) it cannot move from that spot, even if the creature does.

Your Nature check determines the potential radius of the scrying.

&lt;table&gt;Nature Check Result	Effective Distance
19 or lower	20 squares
20-24	40 squares
25-29	1 mile
30-39	5 miles
40 or higher	25 miles&lt;/table&gt;

You can see and hear through the sensor. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.

Forestwatch creates a scrying sensor - a glamour that shimmers and dances in the air - that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. If the target of this ritual notices your scrying sensor, the scrying is immediately dispelled.

Powerful warding magic, such as the Forbiddance ritual, block Forestwatch. If the subject's location is warded in such a manner, you learn that as soon as you begin the ritual, so you can interrupt the ritual and not expend any components.

When you perform this ritual, you must be near a large, natural body of water. When the ritual concludes, a slender, eladrin hand reached from the pool, bearing two small, perfectly faceted emeralds (each emerald is worth 100 gp). When activated, each functions as a magical sensor allowing you to gaze into the emerald and see and hear as if you were standing where the matching emerald was. An emerald can be activated by spending a healing surge and focusing on the emerald; each emerald may be activated once per day.

Activating the emeralds creates a shimmer in the air that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. If the target of this ritual notices the aura, the target can use a standard action to focus its will in an attempt to destroy the sensor. Make an opposed Wisdom check; if the target's result is higher than yours, the sensor is destroyed and you spend one healing surge but regain no hit points (or take damage equal to your healing surge value if you don't have any healing surges left). The subject can repeat this effort until the sensor is destroyed or the duration ends.

Your Nature check determines the duration of the scrying.

When you perform this ritual, choose a specific weapon. The next time that weapon wounds another creature the wound immediately becomes a magical sensor, allowing you to see and hear as if you were standing adjacent to the creature.

You have no inherent way to discern where the sensor is in relation to you, but careful observation might give you some clues. The sensor moves with the subject for the duration of the effect.

If anyone performs a divination or scrying ritual intended to gather information about you - such as someone using Consult Oracle to ask questions about you, or using Sight of the Gods to spy on you - you instantly become aware of it. You do not learn the nature of the ritual caster's questions or efforts. You learn only the identity the ritual caster well enough to scry on him or her in turn. In addition, you can instantly send a bitter message through the link, forcing your foe to spend healing surges, or - if the target has no healing surges available - take damage equal to each surge value. In order to force the target to spend healing surges, you must overcome his Will defense with your Arcana check. If you succeed, your Arcana check determines how many healing surges the target must spend.

As long as the ritual is in effect, it redirects any attempt to scry on you. While the viewer will indeed see you as you are, your surroundings are drawn from a second scrying sensor you create. So while the heroes are exploring a dungeon, a scryer might see them in a city, cautiously making their way through the streets, checking for traps, their torches held high. The ritual's caster can determine the nature, though not the specifics, of the false background. 

There is a chance that the scryer can detect this false vision. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to realize the vision is false.

When you perform this ritual, choose a specific creature. You create a magical sensor adjacent to that creature, and you can see and hear as if you were standing in the square where your sensor is located. You need not personally know or have ever seen the subject. However, when performing the ritual you must describe your intended subject with sufficient clarity that the ritual unambiguously knows which creature you're talking about. This ritual can show you a creature anywhere in the world, and on any plane.

The magic of the ritual interprets your statement of intended subject in the most straightforward way possible. If your description is insufficient to determine a specific creature, the ritual fails and no components are expended. If your statement describes a subject other than the one you intended, the ritual still functions and the components are expended.

The Sight of the Gods does not grant their wisdom, so you have no inherent way to discern where the sensor is in relation to you, but careful observation might give you some clues. The sensor moves with the subject for the duration of the effect.

Your Religion check determines the duration of the ritual.

&lt;table&gt;Religion Check Result	Duration
19 or lower	1 round
20-24	2 rounds
25-29	3 rounds
30-39	4 rounds
40 or higher	5 rounds&lt;/table&gt;

You can hear through the sensor as well as see, and you have darkvision through it. Use the Perception skill to determine whether you hear quiet sounds or notice unobtrusive things while observing an area through the sensor.

Sight of the Gods creates a scrying sensor - a shimmer in the air - that watchful creatures might notice. Creatures must succeed on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your level to notice the sensor. If the target of this ritual notices your scrying sensor, the target can use a standard action to destroy the sensor. Make an opposed Wisdom check; if the target's result is higher than yours, the sensor is destroyed and you take damage equal to twice your healing surge value. The subject can repeat this effort until the sensor is destroyed or the duration ends.

Sight of the Gods cannot be blocked by warding magic.

Focus: 
A holy symbol set with a mirror worth at least 20,000 gp. The focus conveys what you see and hear.

Depending on your choice, this ritual functions just like the Observe Creature, View Location, View Object, or Wizard's Sight rituals except that only sound is transmitted through the scrying sensor. You can hear speech or quieter sounds with a successful Perception check, but you do not gain the ability to understand languages you do not otherwise know.

You force space to curve in on itself, forming an inescapable trap. As part of this ritual, you must map the ley lines in an area of no more than one square mile by sprinkling diamond dust and observing the fall, and then walk these lines backwards carrying a rune-carved lodestone. At the end of the ritual, you must bury the lodestone and make an Arcana check to determine the robustness of your trap.

During the duration of the ritual, all creatures in the area cannot move more than 40 squares without ending up at the location where you buried the lodestone. All modes of movement except for teleportation are affected. The trap can be detected with an opposed Perception or Arcana check vs. your Arcana check when you performed the ritual. It can be disarmed with an opposed Thievery or Arcana check vs. your Arcana check when you performed the ritual.

The duration of the curved space effect is 24 hours, but the ritual caster (not his assistants) can prolong this duration by spending a healing surge when the ritual expires, thus renewing the effect for another 24 hours. If the ritual is sustained consistently for an entire year, the effect becomes permanent.

You concentrate, utter the syllables, "En Por," and then throw a pre-prepared pouch of reagents on the ground. Upon contact with the ground, the pouch explodes in a circle of multi-colored, spacebending energy. You and all allies touching you within a close burst 1 disappear and reappear between 35 and 145 feet away. You are drawing upon the primal forces of space, warping and bending it. Because of the volatile nature of bending space, the direction and distance you teleport are uncontrollable and are determined as follows:

Distance: 
Up to 2d12 + 5 squares

Direction: 
Roll 1d8 and use the table below to determine the general direction

&lt;table&gt;Result	Direction
1	North
2	North-East
3	East
4	South-East
5	South
6	South-West
7	West
8	North-West&lt;/table&gt;

The destination must be an area that can be inhabited by the party. The distance result denotes the maximum distance teleported; the destination location furthest along the direction indicated should be used. The direction result provides general guidance as to the direction moved; the exact final destination is subject to the DM's discretion. If no possible target location exists along the determined direction the ritual fails, the pouch does not explode, and the components are not used.

Preparing the pouch requires 4 hours of uninterrupted time. Once prepared, the ritual can be activated with a brief 6 second mental concentration effort. If used in combat, this ritual can be cast as a standard action. If the ritual fails, i.e., if no suitable target location exists, a minor action is required to pick up the reagent pouch.

As the ritual is not complete until the final mental concentration, only the character that prepared and created the pouch may use it.

You enchant an area to provide you with an automatic escape if anything attempts to teleport into your midst. As part of this ritual, you must anoint a single room (or a burst 4 area) with rare oils and unguents, mixed according to a formula known only to you. You may then apply these oils to yourself and up to eight allies. If any creature that was not anointed by these oils teleports into the area you enchanted, the ritual is discharged and each creature that was anointed can teleport as an immediate interrupt. Only those who are in the anointed area when the ritual is discharged can teleport, and the square they teleport into must be outside the area.

You create a hidden escape route that allows you to disappear undetected and reappear at the permanent teleportation circle of your choice. As part of this ritual, you must draw a circle 10 feet in diameter using ink crafted from the blood of a creature that can turn invisible (such as an imp). This circle must match in every way the permanent teleportation circle that is to be your destination.

When you finish the ritual, make an Arcana check. The circle you drew can be detected only by making an opposed Perception check against this Arcana check. You may designate up to eight of your allies that will be included in the ritual in addition to yourself. At any point during the duration of the ritual, you can discharge the ritual as a minor action. Any included creatures that are within the circle you drew are teleported to the permanent teleportation circle, leaving behind perfect illusory duplicates. This transition is undetectable unless the observer makes an opposed Perception check against the Arcana check you made when you performed the ritual.

The illusion continues for the duration of the ritual and attempts to simulate the sounds and motions that the teleported creatures were making before they left, but the imposture grows less convincing with time. Observers gain a cumulative +1 bonus to Perception checks for each round that has passed since the ritual was discharged.

You breach space to create a narrow tunnel that stretches from your location to a permanent teleport circle elsewhere on the same plane. As part of performing this ritual, you must draw a circle one foot in diameter using powdered semi-precious stones. This new circle must match the permanent teleport circle you wish to link it to in every way except for its size. It disappears when the ritual's duration ends.

While the circles are linked, those near either one can look through to see a misty panorama of the location of the other circle, up to a distance of 60 feet. Any creature that is able to fit though the small circle you drew can use a move action to enter either circle and be teleported to its linked pair. It is also possible to reach through the circle, pick up objects at the other location, and carry them through the Dimensional Mousehole, again limited by the size of the smaller circle.

Allies included in the ritual who  were not asleep when you are teleported are left behind. Being teleported does not wake you, and you cannot predict when during your rest it will take place, so you will be asleep and defenseless for some time at the new location.

You must use this ritual in the world. When you perform this ritual, you transport yourself and up to eight allies to a random spot within the Nine Hells without any guarantee of personal safety. In addition to the component cost, each character must expend a number of healing surges determined by your Religion check.

&lt;table&gt;Religion Check Result	Healing Surges Required
9 or Lower	5
10-19	4
20-29	3
30-39	2
40 or higher	1&lt;/table&gt;

Each character is required to pay this cost. Another character can pay some or all of the required healing surges for another character, but a character unable to pay the required amount is not transported.

At the DM's option, bargaining with the devil might require a skill challenge.

Special: Tieflings have a special connection with the Nine Hells. Consequently, a tiefling who has mastered this ritual or performs it from a scroll does not pay the gp component cost and gains a +5 racial bonus to the Religion check.

You concentrate and inevitably twist the astral ether that determines where a person is. With time and concentration you can bypass doors, chasms, walls, and other barriers. This ritual can also take a certain number of ritual passengers with you. Although the range is not long, a little is often all you need.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Distance	Passengers
19 or Lower	2 squares	1 other person
20-29	4 squares	2 other people
30-39	6 squares	4 other people
40 or higher	8 squares	8 other people&lt;/table&gt;

This ritual teleports you and a certain number of passengers a certain distance. This ritual does not require that you know or see where you are going, merely that you know in which direction and how far you want to go.

If you attempt to Jaunt to an unsuitable spot, such as into a solid object. Everyone takes 1d6 damage for each square teleported, is returned to their starting positions, and the ritual ends with the component cost spent.

An unsuitable spot is either a spot that is completely filled in with a solid material, or partially filled in with a solid material. Attempting to Jaunt into stone, a crowd of people, or an intricate arrangement of wires will trigger the damage and the return to the starting location. Attempting to jaunt into a liquid or someplace that cannot support you, such as over a chasm, will not trigger the damage and will not return you to the starting location.

You prepare a snatch and grab mission that will allow you and your allies to grab your targets and bring them back to this spot. As part of this ritual, you must use rare and costly resins and gums to sketch a temporary teleportation circle 10 feet in diameter. You and up to six of your allies standing within this circle are included in the ritual. When you complete the ritual, make an Arcana check to determine how strongly the temporary circle attracts those within.

At any point during the duration of the ritual, each creature that was included can use a minor action to discharge the ritual, teleporting them back to the temporary circle and ending the effect of the ritual for themselves only. Any creature that was grabbed by the included creature is teleported as well if the Arcana check you made when you performed the ritual exceeds the target's Will defense.

You use your knowledge of an area to allow you and up to eight allies to travel instantly between any two points in the area during the duration of the ritual. As part of performing this ritual, you must use fantastically rare and expensive inks to draw a map of an area you are familiar with. The maximum size of the map is 500 square miles, and you must be in the area shown on the map. Adding more details to the map make it more useful, but only features of a certain size can be mapped. The minimum resolution of the map is 500 feet, making it impossible to arrive at a location with any greater precision. This limitation means that a Marvelous Map is handy for transportation across a continent or a city, but not for navigating within a castle or a dungeon.

At the ritual's completion, make an Arcana check to determine the duration of the ritual.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Duration
19 or Lower	5 minutes
20-39	30 minutes
40 or higher	3 hours&lt;/table&gt;

When you finish making the map, an arrow appears at your current location. During the duration of the ritual, as a move action you can fold the map such that your location touches another location shown on the map, teleporting you and your allies to within 500 feet of that area. The ritual will always place you on solid ground free of immediate hazards. If no such safe place exists near your intended location, the attempt to teleport there fails. If you attempt to travel to a location that is erroneously marked on the map but is not actually present in the area, the ritual ends.

You create an ordinary wooden door that fills a doorway up to 15 feet tall by 10 feet wide. The door has metal fittings, including a handle and hinges that allow it to open normally as well as an unusually large keyhole that appears to be purely decorative, as it is not connected to any visible lock mechanism. When a certain type of item is placed in this keyhole, for the next round, the door will open onto the location of another Mutable Door that the ritual caster (not an assistant) has created using this ritual. During this time, while the door is  open, the squares on either side of the two linked Mutable Doors are treated as being adjacent.

When the ritual to create a Mutable Door is performed, you specify the nature of the item that must be inserted in the keyhole of other Mutable Doors to cause them to open onto this door. The specified item must have a value of at least 500 gp, and the act of placing it in the keyhole destroys the item. Those who wish the Mutable Door to be usable by anyone typically specify gems. For example, inserting a diamond into any of the castle's Mutable Door would cause it to open onto the throne room, while a ruby will lead to the armory. Those who wish to keep the use of their Mutable Doors private, typically specify special items that will be difficult for others to obtain, such as jade discs gilded with different runes for different locations.

You can conjure the conveyance listed next to your Arcana check result, or anything a lower check could summon. The speed is determined by your check result regardless of which vehicle you choose.

The conveyance comes complete with whatever is necessary to power it; carriages are drawn by phantom steeds, and ships sail with arcane winds. As soon as the vehicle takes damage, this means of propulsion ceases to exist, and the vehicle begins to slow. The next round, the conveyance itself fades away, dropping all passengers to the ground.

As part of performing this ritual, you must decorate the object you wish to trap with a depiction of the plane that holds the destination circle, including the rune sequence that designates that circle. The trapped object must be small enough that you could lift it above your head. When you finish preparing this object, make an Arcana check.

The ritual is discharged when the object is touched by any creature other than you and your allies who were present when you performed the ritual. As an immediate interrupt, you make a burst 5 attack centered on the triggering creature, using the Arcana check you made when you created the trap against the Will defense of each creature in the burst. If you hit, the target is teleported to the linked portal.

You create an unstable, one-way passage, allowing you and up to five allies to cross great distances at great risk. An intricate doorway covered in Primordial sigils must be etched into any solid surface. The doorway can be big enough for a Large creature to fit through, but smaller portals can be created if desired. The ritualist must then walk into the doorway and envision a static destination in the Mortal World that he has previously visited. After one round, the doorway vanishes into nothingness. Unfortunately for those who have entered it, the doorway does not immediately transport those within to their destination. Instead, they are trapped in a bewildering realm of chaotic sounds and light that the ritualist must forge his way through with force of will and arcane knowledge. An Arcana check on the part of the ritualist determines how long it takes those who entered the doorway to reach their destination and how addled they shall be when they emerge.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Time Elapsed	Negative Effect
19 or Lower	1d10 days	Travelers weakened for 1d10 hours

40 or higher	1d20 minutes	None&lt;/table&gt;

When the time elapsed indicated by the Arcana check has expired, all who entered the doorway emerge at the destination envisioned by the ritualist and suffer the negative effect noted. Each traveler rolls for the duration of the negative effect individually, should one be suffered. Should the ritualist's destination be inaccessible due to it being destroyed, inhabited, or warded against teleportation, travelers emerge at the nearest unoccupied, unwarded area.

You link two points in space, allowing instant travel between two locations on the same plane. As part of this ritual, you must draw a circle 10 feet in diameter using exotic and costly fluids. This circle is visible to all unless you choose to hide the Spatial Door by using transparent and fast-evaporating fluids. If so, make an Arcana check. Any creature that did not observe you drawing the circle must make an opposed Perception roll against this Arcana check in order to perceive the Spatial Door.

During the duration of the ritual, you can use the same fluids to draw a second circle within one mile of the first, opening a passageway between them. If you chose to hide the first circle, the second circle is similarly hidden. Those who can perceive the Spatial Door can see through the passageway to gain a hazy view of the location of the other circle and the area within 60 feet.

At the time that you draw the second circle, you must decide whether to make an Arcana check to lock the passageway. If you leave it unlocked, until the ritual ends or is dispelled, any creature that can perceive the Spatial Door may pass through either circle and teleport to the location of the other one as a move action. If you choose to lock the passageway, you and your allies who were present when you created both circles can still pass as a move action. All other creatures must use a standard action to make an opposed Strength vs. the Arcana check you made to lock the passageway in order to pass.

When this circle is entered by any creature that was not inside it when you finished the ritual, the trap becomes charged. It discharges as an immediate interrupt when any creatures attempt to leave the circle. When the trap discharges, all creatures in the circle are teleported such that they keep their relative positions but are rotated up to 360 degrees within the circle. You must specify the degree of rotation when you perform the ritual.

To cast this ritual, you must know the sigil sequence of a permanent teleportation circle. During casting, you can temporarily attune one creature (including yourself ) to that teleportation circle. This ritual automatically discharge if the subject is killed, instantly teleporting the subject's remains (and any equipment that was on the subject's person when he was killed) back to that circle from anywhere on the same plane.

While you cast this ritual, the subject must remain within the teleportation circle to which you are attuning him. If the subject leaves the circle before the ritual is complete, the ritual fails and the casting components will be wasted. If you are not the subject, you must also be at the same location as the teleportation circle while you cast this ritual.

Upon completion of the ritual, make an Arcana check. The result determines how long the subject remains attuned to the teleportation circle.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Duration
19 or lower	8 hours
20-29	24 hours
30-39	3 days
40 or higher	1 week&lt;/table&gt;

As long as the subject is still attuned to the circle, the ritual discharges as an immediate reaction. Once this ritual is discharged, the subject is no longer attuned to the circle.

Effects that prevent teleportation can prevent the discharge of this ritual. Equally, if an object or creature is within the teleportation circle when the subject is killed, this ritual will not discharge. In either event, the ritual discharges as soon as the circumstances preventing teleportation cease, as long as this happens within the duration determined when the ritual was cast.

This ritual allows up to eight creatures (including yourself if you wish) to instantly move between one portal and another portal that lies within a certain number of squares. The movement is instantaneous, teleporting the targets from the starting portal to a second chosen portal within range. You can only cast this ritual if you have line of sight to the desired portal, have traveled through the portal previously, or have seen it with a ritual such as View Location. For the purpose of this ritual, a portal means any fixed opening that can be passed through, including a tunnel mouth, door, portcullis, or the hollowed out trunk of a tree.

You must make an Arcana check to determine the number of squares the targets can move.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Squares Teleported
19 or lower	10 squares
20-29	20 squares
30-39	35 squares
40 or higher	50 squares&lt;/table&gt;

If the desired portal is not within the range of the ritual, the ritual fails and nothing happens (though the components are still used up).

Adventurers often use this ritual to quickly pass through areas they have already explored, or to avoid regions that they know are dangerous or troublesome to move through.

You contact the spirit of the wilderness around you and request a vision of the nearest location that has been substantially altered by civilized activity. A glade where a boot has been discarded or a single tree chopped down would not qualify, but a woodsman's hut, a cultivated field or orchard, a subterranean dungeon, or a ruined temple are all possible results of the ritual. Each vision offers a blurred view of the location, as if seen from a hundred feet away on a misty day. Nothing more than 60 feet from the center of the civilized activity can be made out.

If you are given a vision, you may study it for up to five rounds. After that time, you and up to eight allies you can see may choose to be teleported to the location of your vision. If you decide not to be teleported, you may then be shown the next nearest location that qualifies for this ritual. You must choose not to be teleported to each location in order before being shown the next one.

The maximum number of locations you can see in your visions depends on the result of your Nature check.

You create a platform of pure force that is 4 squares long, 3 squares wide, and surrounded by a lip 1 inch high. The platform is covered by an illusion that gives it the appearance of an inconspicuous mundane conveyance, such as a wagon pulled by a pair of weary mules. You specify the details of this illusion at the time that you perform the ritual. Once created, you cannot alter the illusion, although it does change to reflect its circumstances - for example, the wagon's wheels and mules' hooves appear to move as appropriate for the terrain and even get muddy if it rains.

The platform floats three feet above any reasonably solid surface, ignoring difficult terrain. When you are on top of the platform, you can use your move actions to move the platform. The platform can hold up 6,000 pounds, including as many creatures as can fit on top of it without squeezing.

At the completion of the ritual, make an Arcana check. The result determines the platform's speed.

You prepare a spatial displacement intended to send intruders elsewhere without their knowledge. As part of this ritual, you must use ink made from the vitreous humor of a dimensional marauder to draw two invisible temporary teleportation circles, each one up to 30 feet in diameter. Both circles must be within 100 squares of one another on the same plane of existence. When you finish performing the ritual, make an Arcana check to determine how craftily you have set your trap. 

When either circle is entered by any creature that was not inside it when you finished the ritual, the trap becomes charged. It discharges as an immediate interrupt when any creature attempts to leave either circle. When the trap discharges, all creatures in each circle are teleported into the other circle, maintaining their relative positions. Creatures whose level is higher than the ritual caster's cannot charge the trap and are not teleported when the trap is discharged.

Teleported creatures remain unaware of their misdirection unless they make an opposed Perception check vs. the Arcana check you made when you performed the ritual. Bonuses or penalties may apply to this roll depending on the environment.

You contact an extraplanar entity to help you locate the individual you seek, and then teleport to your target's location. When you complete the ritual, make an Arcana check to determine what you must give this entity in order to be able to perform the ritual.

30-39	A description an intelligent ghost could use to identify the target, such as its name
40 or higher	A description even a stupid demon could understand, such as "the creature that was wounded here yesterday"&lt;/table&gt;

This ritual does not provide you with any information about the target's location, only the coordinates necessary to teleport you and up to eight allies to a point within 40 squares of the target's current position. You cannot control the precise location in which you will arrive, although it will always be solid ground that is free of immediate hazards. If no such location exists, the ritual fails, but you do not have to expend component costs. Upon arrival, you and your allies are dazed (save ends).

You target a non-hostile Tiny animal; usually a toad, lizard, or spider. The animal must remain within 5 squares of you for the time necessary to perform the ritual. Once the ritual is complete, the animal always occupies the same square you do, staying with you until its service is discharged.

Before taking an extended rest, you can command the Animal Watcher to provide a lookout for you. While sleeping, you use your passive Perception score to determine whether you detect approaching danger and wake up, but without the -5 penalty for being asleep.

After you take an extended rest, your influence ends, and the animal reverts to its natural behavior. You can have only one Animal Watcher with you at any one time - any attempt to bind another Animal Watcher results in the subsequent ritual's failure (though ritual components are still expended).

You ward a door, window, or some other portal to bring harmto any who open, enter, or pass through the warded area. You may pass normally, but any who you have not designated trigger the effect as an immediate reaction to opening or passing through the warded area. When you perform the ritual, you can designate other creatures to pass safely. The options you may choose from are the same as that for Arcane Lock (see 4E D&amp;D Player's Handbook). The Arcane Trap uses your Perception check to detect invisible or hidden creatures passing through the warded area.

Upon completing the ritual you choose a power you have learned that has a range of close burst or close blast. A burst effect must center on the warded portal, the exact area of a blast power must be set when the power is chosen and must be adjacent to the warded portal. The result of your Arcana check determines the maximum level of the power you can choose; the chosen power is expended without effect at the end of the ritual. This check, with a +5 bonus, also sets the DC for Thievery checks to disable the trap and Perception checks to notice it.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Level of Blast or Burst Power
9 or lower	Level 3 or less
10-19	Level 7 or less
20-29	Level 13 or less
30-39	Level 17 or less
40 or higher	Level 25 or less&lt;/table&gt;

If the trap is triggered, the DM rolls an attack using your attack bonuses, as if you used the selected power in the warded area. Bonuses from implements or similar sources do not apply to the Arcane Trap. You do not need to be in the same area or even on the same plane when the trap is triggered.

A selected area can only be warded by one Arcane Trap; a second casting of this ritual in a warded area fails without effect (although any component cost must still be paid). The warding effect lasts for 24 hours, or until triggered, but the ritual caster (not any assistants) can extend this duration by expending a healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. The caster does not need to be in the same area or even on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the effect becomes permanent until triggered.

You place a magical mark upon a lock, latch, or any object the target can interact with. When the target touches the object, the mark vanishes and is replaced with a floating flesh-colored ball the size of a fist. Although it appears solid, the ball has no actual physical presence. The ball rises to the shoulder of the target, a mouth appears over the ball, and it begins screaming annoyingly in the target's ear. Every minute, the scream pauses for one round - the ball gives the illusion of taking a deep breath - and starts up again. Your Arcana check determines how long the annoying companion lasts.

Anyone plagued by an annoying companion suffers a -5 penalty to all Charisma-based skill rolls, a -2 penalty to Perception checks, and cannot take extended rests. In addition, the target automatically fails all Stealth checks and cannot surprise opponents. The ritual can be dismissed by you or by any arcane caster that studies the orb for 10 minutes and then beats your Arcana skill check with his. You may replace the scream with loud laughter, moaning, or other noises generated by other parts of the body. The mouth cannot form words.

This ritual affects one stronghold, castle, dungeon or similar area you own or inhabit. The area can be no larger than 20 squares by 20 squares and 50 feet (10 squares) in height.

All corridors are filled with magical zones of fog. Any squares in these zones are considered heavily obscured, except for those adjacent to you, which are considered lightly obscured.

All doors in the area are magically locked. Your Arcana check +5 determines the difficulty for Thievery skill checks and Strength checks made to open these doors.

All staircases in the area are filled with zones of magical webs. All squares are treated as difficult terrain, and any creature ending its movement in a square covered by the magical web is immobilized (save ends).

All intersections are filled with zones of magical confusion that makes the target go in another direction than they intended (determined randomly), unless they make an immediate save against this effect.

A number of doors determined by your Arcana check are cloaked by an illusion, making it appear as if they were plain wall. Creatures that view or interact with the illusion are entitled to Insight checks to detect the fact that it is a false wall. This check's DC equals your Arcana check result. A creature is allowed a check the first time it sees the illusion and each time it interacts with it. A creature that touches an illusion automatically determines that the image is a fake.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Number of Doors Warded
19 or lower	2

You may also place two stinking clouds within two squares within the warded area. The first time a creature enters one of the squares, a stinking cloud (as if cast by you) appears as an immediate reaction, centered on that square. The stinking cloud works exactly as the 5th-level daily wizard power (see 4E D&amp;D Player's Handbook), except that you cannot move it and it is sustained by the ritual for 5 minutes.

An affected creature whose level is greater than your Arcana check minus ten may enter the building or room but takes damage equal to your Arcana check.

Insubstantial creatures treat every square within the area you create with this ritual as difficult terrain.

You lay down a wall of 10 contiguous squares (you must physically move from square to square) on any natural terrain (grass, forest, etc). Once finished, the ritual is active. You can include the names of up to 5 allies (including yourself ) that you want to be unaffected by the ritual. Anything else that steps upon the square activates a hazard (see below).

Hazard
Perception
* Creatures notice the sigils on the ground with a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + one-half your Nature check.

Trigger
An enemy enters a warded square.

Opportunity Action Melee
Targets: Creature in the warded square

Attack: +5 + one-half your Nature check vs. Reflex
Hit: The target is immobilized (save ends).
Effect: Once a square has been activated, it becomes difficult terrain. However, it no longer acts as a hazard.

Countermeasures
* A character aware of the danger represented by the sigil can leap over a square with an Athletics check (DC 6, or DC 11 without a running start).
* A character adjacent to a warded square can disable the sigil with a Thievery check equal to your Nature check.

This ritual consecrates a building no larger than 30 squares by 30 squares and 100 feet (20 squares) in height to be a holy place of your god. The building must be either a place of worship or home to someone who worships the god it is be dedicated to. Once complete, the ritual remains in effect until a deed that goes against the teachings of the god of the sanctuary is committed by a worshipper of the god within the sanctuary. For example, if a worshipper of a god of peace committed a murder within the sanctuary, it would end the ritual. Misdeeds by visitors, enemies, or those of other faiths have no effect on the ritual.

Once the building is consecrated, no minion with the shadow or aberrant origin or the undead, demon, or devil keyword whose level is lower level than your Religion check result minus 10 may enter the sanctuary. Any creature that enters the sanctuary that is vulnerable to radiant damage has that vulnerability increased by your Religion check result check minus 20. While within the sanctuary, any followers of the god to which the sanctuary is dedicated gain a +2 bonus to saving throws and Endurance and Heal checks.

This ritual creates a slick patch of ice in one or more squares you designate within your line of sight, no matter the time of year or temperature level of the environment. The ice created is very thin; a DC 25 Perception check is required to detect a square containing ice. The size of the patch is determined by the Nature check made as part of casting the ritual.

&lt;table&gt;Nature Check Result	Area Affected	Duration
19 or lower	Burst 3	10 minutes (or until dispelled)
20-29	Burst 5	20 minutes
30-39	Burst 7	1 hour
40 or higher	Burst 10	2 hours&lt;/table&gt;

Any non-flying Medium or smaller creature entering an icy square must make an Acrobatics with a DC equal to 10 + one-half your nature check to continue movement; once this check is made, no other check is required by that creature for the duration of the ritual. Larger creatures are unaffected unless their entire space is covered in ice.

If the Acrobatics check is failed by 4 or less, the creature must move at half speed through all icy squares; it may attempt the check again on its following turn or with another move action. Failure by 5 or more causes the creature to fall prone; it may attempt the check again on its following turn or with another move action.

The cost of the ritual is dependent on the time of year. If the ritual is cast in winter, add 50 to the component cost. In spring or fall, add 100 gp. Casting the ritual in summer requires 150 gold over the base cost.

This ritual dulls the senses of animals (natural beasts) near those targeted by this ritual, making the target undetectable through sight, smell, or hearing. For creatures with the natural origin and the beast type to detect targets of this ritual, they must beat your Nature check result with a Perception check. Failure means the target of the ritual remains invisible to the animal. The animal may make another check each round that you are in the vicinity of the animal. This ritual affects you and up to four other ritual participants you designate.

This ritual will not protect you if you move into a square adjacent to an animal, or if you make any attacks against an animal. In both cases, the ritual immediately ends for that target.

You ward a building (or burst 10) against all forms of invisibility. Any invisible creature entering the area simply loses its invisibility, while any creature that attempts to become invisible finds that it is impossible. Creatures in the area can still gain concealment from mundane means. Your Arcana check determines how long the ward lasts.

This rod calms storms in the region around it, making a heavy rain the worst that will happen in the two mile radius area protected by the Lightning Rod. Snow, winds, and other forms of weather may occur, but the damage they inflict will never be serious as long as the Lightning Rod remains. Any attempt to use the Control Weather ritual in this area to summon up a precipitation of any sort suffers a penalty equal to your Arcana or Nature check result minus 10.

Within a smaller radius around the Lightning Rod, attacks that have the lightning or thunder keywords are suppressed. Any creature within 10 squares of the rod gains resist thunder and lightning equal to your Arcana or Nature check result minus 20.

This ritual remains in effect until the Lightning Rod is pulled from the ground or destroyed. It may be pulled from the ground as a standard action or if it is struck with any power that would knock a target prone.

You call upon the spirits of peace and calmness, creating a white
banner that suffuses the area with an unnatural serenity that presses down heavily on every violent impulse. By completing this ritual, you summon spirits that prevent any creatures in the area of effect from performing intentional acts of violence-this includes spells, powers, and so on. Any creature that attempts to take a violent action within the warded area is stunned as an immediate interrupt (save ends). Because the spirits base their judgment off of intention, there is no way to get around them by performing actions that "accidentally" result in someone on Neutral Ground coming to deliberate harm.

The spirits cannot prevent violent actions or intentions that have already taken place; for instance, if a poisoned drink were already on the banquet table, casting this ritual would not prevent the effects of the poison. Nor can they prevent a creature from attacking into the area of effect, as long as they are outside the range of the banner's influence.

The area of the effect is based on your Arcana check, and is given as a burst.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Affected Area
19 or lower	Burst 2
20-29	Burst 5
30-39	Burst 10
40 or higher	Burst 20&lt;/table&gt;

You can cause the banner to remain an additional hour by expending an additional healing surge. This healing surge must be expended by the ritual caster, not any assistants, and must be spent each hour in order to maintain the ritual.

This ritual builds up your natural resistance to toxins, trading some vitality in the process. The target of this ritual must expend a healing surge as part of this ritual, but gains no hit points for doing so. This healing surge cannot be regained until the duration of this ritual is over. At the conclusion of the ritual, the target gains a bonus based on your Heal or Nature check.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Bonus to Defense(s)
19 or lower	+1 to Fortitude, Reflex, and Will defenses
20-29	+1 to all defenses
30-39	+2 to Fortitude, Reflex, and Will defenses, +1 to AC
40 or higher	+2 to all defenses&lt;/table&gt;

An area cannot be warded by more than one Sanctum ritual; only the most recent casting takes effect. If a new casting is placed in an area warded by a permanent Sanctum, the permanent effect is suppressed only until the second Sanctum's duration ends or the second Sanctum is made permanent.

The warding effect lasts for 24 hours, but the ritual caster (not any assistants) can extend this duration by expending a healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. The caster does not need to be in the same area or even on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the effect becomes permanent.

Using age-old folklore concerning the undead, this ritual focuses on distracting and confusing vampires or any intelligent, corporeal undead humanoid that try to break the defenses the ritual erects. The main component of this ritual is mustard seeds for counting or a net to be unwoven. These tasks work to trap the attention of the vampire, making it extremely difficult to focus on anything else, even when being attacked.

This ritual protects up to 10 squares, and the squares need not be contiguous. For example, you could protect the squares around the doors into a room while not protecting the rest of the room. A vampire can spot the signs of this ritual protecting a square with a Perception check against a DC equal to your Arcana or Religion check result. Any vampire or corporeal undead humanoid of lower level than your Arcana or Religion check result minus 10 that enters a protected square is stunned (save ends). The vampire or undead creature suffers a penalty to its saving throw against the stun effect based on the Arcana or Religion check result. Once a protected square has been triggered, it is no longer protected.

Creatures cannot see the location and space bends such that creatures cannot possibly bump into the location. Magical attempt to view the location simply fail.

A creature can find the location if somebody who already knows of its existence tells the subject, or if it succeeds on a Perception check with a DC equal to 10 + your Arcana check while adjacent to the warded area.

When you cast this ritual you create a burst 4 zone of warding which repels all normal weather conditions, preventing them from taking effect in the area. The strength of the ward, and thus the weather conditions it keeps out of the area, is determined by a Nature check.

&lt;table&gt;Nature Check Result	Weather Condition Warded Against
19 or lower	Light rain, light winds, mist
20-24	Fog, heavy rain, moderate winds, sleet
25-29	Snow, torrential rain
30-34	High winds, blizzard, sandstorm
35 or higher	Hurricane force winds, whirlwind&lt;/table&gt;

If the check indicates that a weather condition is negated by the ritual, the weather condition cannot manifest within the ward's boundaries and does not affect any creatures within the burst. Any weather conditions unaffected by the ward can manifest normally, even if accompanying a weather condition prevented by the ritual. Therefore, your Nature check might keep out torrential rain but not the high winds that accompany it.

Weather conditions outside the ward are unaffected, and creatures traveling outside it can be affected normally (though, if they return to the safety of the Storm Ward, they are protected). Elemental creatures are unharmed by the ward and magical or supernatural weather conditions, such as those created by various powers, continue unabated.

This ritual wards a single Gargantuan ocean-going vehicle so that it will never sink due to purely natural means. It will never capsize due to storms, hole its hull on rocks, or rot away due to barnacles and similar creatures. It can be damaged and sunk normally by the act of any creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or more. This ritual does not make a vehicle invulnerable to damage, but instead allows it to narrowly avoid threats by a mix of luck and arcane power. This ritual provides no protection for the crew or cargo on board; they may still be injured or thrown overboard as normal.

The duration of this ritual depends on your Arcana check result.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Duration
19 or lower	1 day
20-29	3 days
30-39	1 week
40 or higher	1 month&lt;/table&gt;

You ward a single room (or a burst 4 area), against a chosen power source (such as arcane, divine, or martial). Creatures within the warded area gain a bonus to defenses against attacks with the chosen power source. Your Arcana check determines the bonus to defense.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Bonus to Defense(s)
19 or lower	+1 to Fortitude, Reflex, and Will defenses
20-29	+1 to all defenses
30-39	+2 to Fortitude, Reflex, and Will defenses, +1 to AC
40 or higher	+2 to all defenses&lt;/table&gt;

An area cannot be warded by more than one Sanctum ritual; only the most recent casting takes effect. If a new casting is placed in an area warded by a permanent Sanctum, the permanent effect is suppressed only until the second Sanctum's duration ends or the second Sanctum is made permanent.

The warding effect lasts for 24 hours, but the ritual caster (not any assistants) can extend this duration by expending a healing surge every 24 hours to sustain it. The caster does not need to be in the same area or even on the same plane to sustain the effect. If the ritual's effect is sustained without interruption for a year and a day, the effect becomes permanent.

This ritual creates a magical rune that, when activated, teleports the creature that activated it to a square you specify. This rune fills an area that is no larger than a burst 2 area. Your Arcana check result determines the DC of the Perception check to detect the rune. When casting the ritual, you can name creatures or set conditions that allow passage through the area without activating the rune. When a creature does activate the rune, it is subject to an attack equal to your level +5 vs. Reflex. On a hit, the target is immediately teleported to a square of your choice within 20 squares. Commonly this results in the victim being trapped in a dungeon or other type of confinement. When the rune is triggered, you become aware that it has been triggered regardless of your distance from the ritual's area. Once activated, the rune disappears and the area is no longer warded.
