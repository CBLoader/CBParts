    <Prereqs> ~TIKBALANG </Prereqs>
    <Flavor> Swift defenders of Kalikasan, creatures of brawn and guile. </Flavor>
    <specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>
    <specific name="Speed"> 7 squares </specific>
    <specific name="Characteristics"> enduring, fraternal, impulsive, protective, swift, wild </specific>
    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Tikbalangs are astounding specimens, about a head taller than the imposing dragonborn. They combine equine and human features, with a horse-like head and long legs that end in hooves complementing a slender, humanoid torso. Fur is prominent but short all over their bodies, with a range of colors similar to those found on horses.
	A tikbalang's most prominent feature, however, is its impressive mane. If tikbalangs are ever seen as creatures of vanity, it is because of the amount of attention they dedicate to these locks of hair. They have been known to spend hours washing their hair and softening it with coconut oil. Others have even been known to knot charms and small talismans into them to form intricate designs. Perhaps this attention to their mane adds fuel to the rumoured tikbalang weakness. Each tikbalang is said to possess a golden strand of hair in their mane that, when wrested off and tied into a ring, allows one to charm one of these fey creatures.
	Tikbalang are also accomplished Pintados, and they have been known to sport primal tattoos that depict their swiftness. Common motifs include designs reminiscent of clouds and gusts of wind.
	As fey creatures, tikbalang live longer than humans do. They reach adulthood in as few as 14 harvests, but can live to see as many as a hundred harvests. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> Tikbalangs are creatures of the wild, and their approach to life is as impulsive as their origins. They do not share the patience of other long-lived fey, for what is the point of living long if all you do is wait the whole time? Action is the gift of life, and tikblangs are among the swiftest fey to respond to danger. Thus, other fey value them as the first line of defence against interlopers. In many cases, they are the only line of defence needed.
	Tikbalang foals grow up seeing their elders defending Kalikasan from harm, whether through forcing ignorant humans to respect the wilds and their fey inhabitants, or repulsing vicious creatures of shadow that seek to subvert nature. The young ones are thus encouraged to join in this sacred duty, and their brothers and sisters all assist in their upbringing. A strong sense of brotherhood and community is instinctive in their society, and most tikbalangs develop a strong sense of commitment to their peers.
	Tikbalang clans refer to themselves as a kapatiran, a term that translates as brotherhood or compact. Other than their own parents, a datu that acts as its warchief, and a sect of spiritual leaders known as the babaylan, a tikbalang views everybody in the kapatiran as a brother or sister, part of an extended family. Tikbalang adventurers have been known to extend this view to their companions, given time.
	It is uncommon for tikbalang to revere gods; most instead revere the purity of the natural world. Those who do worship a deity usually revere those gods who teach the value of honor among brothers, as well as gods and goddesses who have strong ties to nature. These tikbalang are not treated differently from those who prefer more primal beliefs. Interestingly, many deities who espouse honor are also pioneers of brick, mortar, and other forms of "civilization", something that most tikbalangs are vehemently against. Tikbalang who worship these deities have views that clash with outsiders that share the same religious patron. </specific>

Like many fey creatures, the mysterious tikbalang are forest guardians that one will only see if they allow you to. But unlike their gnomish or elven cousins, they have little reason to hide their presence from those that offend them. Though they also employ deceptive magic to ward off the many gates to Kalikasan, they are just as likely to literally kick a trespasser out of their demesne.

Play a tikbalang if you want . . .
* to be mysterious and forceful.
* to be a creature of magic and physical might.
* to be a member of a race that favors the barbarian, paladin, and warlock classes.

You tie the golden mane around your ring finger, which causes you to lose one of your ring item slots for the duration of this ritual. This process allows you to exercise a degree of control over the tikbalang (whose level must not exceed yours) that produced the strand. The creature need not be in the immediate vicinity, but you must be in the same plane of existence as the creature while you perform this ritual.
	Upon the completion of this ritual, it begins to rain for 10 miles around you, regardless of the season. The rain will even fall during a cloudless, sunny day. At the Dungeon Master's discretion, the rain may or may not have an effect on visibility or lighting; it can be a purely aesthetic effect with no game changes.
	This ritual has been known to backfire on the caster; its effectiveness and duration depends on your Arcana check:

19 or lower: The tikbalang has immediate authority over you and can issue one command you can obey, one that takes up to a day of effort to accomplish.

20-24: You bind the tikbalang to a minor pact. Before rolling initiative on one encounter during the next 24 hours, you can call upon the tikbalang to join the battle by your side. It teleports to a space within 5 squares of you of its own choosing, rolls initiative, and tries to protect you during the	encounter. However, it retains its free will, and you cannot command it to perform specific tasks in combat.

25-34: You bind the tikbalang to a moderate pact. In addition to being able to call upon it within the next 24 hours, as above, you can command the creature to perform a task that takes up to a day of effort to accomplish.

35-39: You bind the tikbalang to a powerful pact. Within the next 24 hours, it accompanies you on your adventure, and tries to protect you to the best of its ability. However, it retains its free will, and you cannot command it to perform specific tasks in combat. Alternatively, you can command the tikbalang to perform a task that requires up to a week of effort to accomplish.

40 or higher: You bind the tikbalang to a supreme pact. Within the next week, it accompanies you on your adventure, and tries to protect you to the best of its ability. It will even give its life to protect yours if the situation arises. Alternatively, you can command the tikbalang to perform a task that requires up to a harvest season's length in effort. While it retains its free will during the extent of this ritual, the tikbalang is inclined to respond favourably to requests that you make over that period of time. The Dungeon Master is the final arbiter on what the tikbalang will and will not do while this ritual is in effect.

	Once the task is completed or the time has elapsed, the tikbalang (or you) will be released from service, and the golden mane turns into a nondescript strand of horse hair. Issuing impossible tasks, such as forcing the tikbalang to fly, discharges the ritual, as is issuing tasks that are blatantly suicidal.
	Removing the gold mane from your finger immediately ends the ritual, and the tikbalang is no longer compelled. You cannot remove it if you are the one compelled by this ritual. Finally, you cannot use this ritual if you have no ring item slots remaining.

You can make unarmed attacks with much greater effectiveness than most combatants. When you make a weapon attack such as a melee basic attack, you can use the monk unarmed strike, which is a weapon in the unarmed weapon group. This weapon has the off-hand weapon property and a +3 proficiency bonus, and it deals 1d8 damage. You must have a hand free to use your monk unarmed strike, even if you're kicking, kneeing, elbowing, or head-butting a target.

	Like the winds, tikbalangs are swift, unseen, and unpredictable. They can feel the powerful magic of the winds as their manes swim through it, and many take up the arcane arts because of this connection. However, only the truly skilled can gather this magic to power their spells. These tikbalangs are known as the eldritch runners.
	Just like most mages, you prefer to stay outside melee, preferring to direct the flow of battle from a safe distance. But to affect real change, you know that galloping through the thick of things is necessary. You dart into the fight one moment and are gone the next; just like the wind that empowers you.

	There are those who see the tikbalangs for their inherent magical nature and their ability to mislead travellers. They view tikbalangs as a nuisance when travelling through the thick forests, but they aren't seen as an immediate, physical threat. Those who hold these beliefs have never had the misfortune of dealing with a Razormane Rampager.
	Razormane Rampagers are creatures of strength and primal magic. Their manes permanently harden into bristles, and grow into hundreds of sharp daggers in the heat of battle. They also become larger and more terrifying than other tikbalangs, sometimes growing to 8 feet tall as they tap into their anger.
	As a Razormane Rampager, you see combat as the most efficient way to drive off intruders. You lack the subtlety of your kin, but you are no less effective at your task. Let others be the wind of deception; you are the typhoon that destroys everything in your path.
