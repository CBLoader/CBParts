    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Long before you came into your psionic powers, you had a knack for reading the emotions in other people. You could always tell when something was wrong, bond with people who liked you, and sever connections with those who meant you harm. Close friends marveled when you finished their sentences. You had a gift, a talent that revealed itself in a profound way when you came into the fullness of your psionic ability. Your childhood tricks evolved into something more, until you could almost hear people's thoughts and read their moods and emotions as if they were words on a page. </specific>

From the time you first felt another's emotion, from the moment you experienced another's thought, you have struggled against the flood that threatens to drown out your identity. It seemed you would never grow comfortable with your strange talent and yet, against all odds, you did. You developed your concentration to drive back outside influences, but you still can't remember the last time you were alone in your head.
Training, focus, or natural adaptability has let you control the voices invading your thoughts. You can now single them out and use them to warn you of hidden dangers or to find ways around a foe's defenses. In effect, your supernatural senses give you cues to leading and fighting in battle
