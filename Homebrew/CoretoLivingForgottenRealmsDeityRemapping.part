  <!-- Converting Core Rules Deities

If you&#8217;ve chosen a deity from the Player&#8217;s Handbook or a D&D Essentials player book,
you must convert your choice to the equivalent deity found in the FORGOTTEN REALMS.
Use the following equivalency chart to convert from the core rules pantheon to the
appropriate Realms-specific deity. You may need to alter your character&#8217;s alignment
to match properly with the Realms deity. If you have a Channel Divinity feat that
references a core rules deity, that feat remains a valid character option for the
Realms-equivalent deity, or you may retrain the feat. The Forgotten Realms Player&#8217;s
Guide includes Channel Divinity feats for all the Realms deities listed on the chart.
Use the Realms-equivalent deity for any other rule (such as a magic item) that
specifies a core rules deity.

You exemplify the virtues of Erathis. In life, you abide by and enforce the laws of your people. You have defended your home against myriad creeping evils and brought light to the dark places in the world. In battle, you know you are only as powerful as the warriors who fight beside you, and you strive to guide them to victory just as fervently as you take up a weapon. Erathis has taken special notice of your devotion and your prowess, and she has blessed you with a powerful touch of her golden light.

To be a gatekeeper of the golden palace, as you are, one does not need a specific power source or skill set. One needs only to value the lives of their allies as strongly as their own, and to know that it is more important for an arrow to strike its target than it is to be the one who fires the arrow. With your allies at your side and Erathis in your heart, you intend to litter the battlefield with fallen enemies—even if you never lift a sword.

Unwavering in your fidelity to your goddess and the creed she set before your people, you have become the greatest among your kind. Your name shall be a dark reminder to all shadar-kai who aspire to greatness for ages to come. Perhaps you have even warmed the bleak heart of winter and risen above those who must merely join the ranks of the sorrowsworn.
The Queen's Right Hand: Your final doom is done, and you have emerged whole and gloriously alive. Death has not fled from you, but she has instead pulled you close under her black wings. Although even gods can die, you are all but eternal in body and in fable.
Now is the time to go before your beloved queen and receive your greatest rewards. To you might be added dominion over the borders of Letherna and command over the Raven Knights, sorrowsworn nobles who watch those lands. If this is the preordained time, exarch of Letherna, perhaps you'll marshal the Raven Queen's forces to bring death to all of her remaining enemies.
Whatever the case, you stand proudly beside the deity of your people as an icon of what others can achieve. You serve her as advisor, confidant, and perhaps even lover. What will you do now that you alone have the most influence with your goddess? Might you intercede for your people? The dead? Those great ones, heroes and villains who stride the cosmos still . . . in your shadow?
Does the thirst for power still burn within you, overriding your ardor in the end? You know as well as the Raven Queen, who herself slew an elder god of the dead, that death can die. Could the very throne of your goddess one day be yours? </specific>

You have traveled the planes as a committed representative of the pact that shapes shadar-kai traditions. In your way, you've shown death the respect it deserves and your deific matron true devotion, never shrinking from your duty. Through obedience to shadar-kai “convention,” you've brought down foes few could imagine, much less face. Still you stand. Beings across the cosmos know and fear you as an envoy of fickle fortune. Even those who don't know you sense that you are beloved by death herself, now on the brink of the greatest reward all shadar-kai could hope for.

You won the right to claim your place among the peerless Raven Knights. You don the black garb worn by all in this august order, cladding yourself in the soft velvet robes and wielding the deity's power in her name. In reward for your eternal service, the deity grants you a mighty fortress and lands in the Shadowfell to rule as you wish, warriors to fight beneath your banner, and servants to attend to your every wish. You might be a servant still, but you live as a king. 
Dark Servitor: The deity's favor reveals itself in your flesh even before you earn the title. From the moment you begin your final quest, your body transforms, subtle at the start but profound when you overcome the last obstacle to your prize. Your connections to the natural world weaken as the Shadowfell asserts its influence over you, opening your eyes to new possibilities. Your facial features change, becoming monstrous but strangely alluring for all its bestial aspect. In time, you erase any connections to your former self when you become a sorrowsworn in truth.
By the time you complete your final quest, your old life is a dream compared to the power, prestige, and glory ahead. With your affairs in order, you embark to bring honor and glory to the deity, to join her other trusted servants as her chosen champion. You bear a new burden to protect the deity who entrusted you with such power. How you meet your mistress's enemies and whether you but do with the same loyalty and devotion you did earlier is up to you and your ambition. You might continue as you have or turn your considerable power to reach further than you ever thought possible. </specific>

The Raven Queen's influence across the Shadowfell depends on trusted agents: those sorrowsworn and shadar-kai who make up the esteemed order of the Raven Knights. Charged with protecting the Raven Queen's realm and safeguarding the Shadowfell from those who would pervert its dark power for dread purposes, they move with impunity across the plane, even going so far as to venture into distant worlds where they bring battle to the Raven Queen's myriad enemies. To join this order, you have worked to prove your worth and dedication to the deity and win a place among these guardians. Your fate might be to serve the deity as her chosen champion, but what better destiny could you choose after a life spent fighting in her name?

The transition to death is a holy road on which all living things are pilgrims. Every creature steps onto that road at birth. When fate's appointed hour comes, every creature steps off into whatever waits beyond the finite and visible path. So it has been, and so it should be. These are the truths of the Raven Queen.
	Yet some do not hold to the proper path. Brazen mortals defy the natural order by avoiding that righteous hour of ending. A few do so by magic or other means, the most common of which is to become undead.
	Undead aren't, in and of themselves, offensive to the Raven Queen. Still, shambling dead brought back to a mockery of life through foul magic deserve to be destroyed. So do those undead that defy true death by serving other entities, such as Orcus or Vecna. A few bold souls manage to elude death without otherwise blaspheming the Raven Queen's edicts. Still, demise must come for them in time as well.
	It is the duty of any who serve the Raven Queen to bring down the proud, showing them the equality that only death provides. Within temples where the Raven Queen is esteemed above all others, the clergy offers support and training for those who would be her instruments of death. Cults form around the ideal of righteous killing, of becoming heralds of death. Common folk know of the Raven Queen's heralds and whisper of their mission when sudden loss of life visits the prideful, the wicked, or those cursed by undeath.
	You have consciously devoted yourself to becoming a tool in the Raven Queen's wintry hands. Perhaps you came to this commitment on your own, or maybe you have an affiliation with the Raven Queen's hierarchy in the world. The origin of your connection to the mistress of winter makes little difference. As a harbinger of destiny, you know that every foe who falls before you has met its appropriate end.

Death is the natural course for all things, from the lowly insect to the mightiest of gods. It is not an end, of course, but a beginning—the first step onto the road into the unknown. For you, death offers little fear or concern because you are confident that the Raven Queen will shepherd you to whatever fate your long service has earned. This comfort and understanding forms the cornerstone of your beliefs, and you carry this message wherever you go, consoling the grieving or speeding those who deserve to meet the Raven Queen on their way.

Under the cloak of night, tyrants and murderers grow restless. They sense an intent gaze upon them, like a bird of prey circling in for the kill. Sometimes this unease is enough to discourage despicable acts. But far too often, a more direct course of action needs to be taken, and the silvered head of an arrow puts down evil.

The Arrows of the Moonbow are a scattered sect of sworn brothers and sisters who dedicate their lives to ensuring that each mortal has a fair chance at writing his or her own destiny and changing his or her own stars. The Arrows travel far and wide, seeking no reward but that which they confiscate from the corpses of their targets. All sorts of divine heroes work among their ranks but, regardless of inclination, they all come to favor subterfuge, trickery and, above all, stealth.

Is being brave still something with which you struggle? Do you have any fears from a past you never conquered?</specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> Every sailor worth his salt prays to Kord from time to time. To do otherwise is to invite his storms upon your ship. But you’ve never feared his storms. When the lightning slashes the sky and the waves toss the ship like a leaf on the wind, you like nothing better than to be at the prow, leaning out into the tempest like a living figurehead. Other sailors think you’re crazed. On a ship your bravery cannot be doubted, but when the storms come, your sanity has been questioned. You’ve been lashed to the mast, and some have accused you of attracting Kord’s wrath. You know the truth, though. On the sea you hear Kord the clearest, and in his storms you laugh along with him.
     Were you captain of a ship or just a crew member? On what kinds of vessels did you sail: merchant, military, or any boat that left port? Why don’t you sail as often as you once did? Is there some danger in the sea you aren’t facing? Do you seek something on land such as a treasure or special magic item?</specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> You were a weakling and a coward, bullied and intimidated by too many people to count. When you could, you avoided conflict with a glib tongue or by hiding. Then one day a thunderbolt struck you out of the blue sky. You awoke in the arms of friends who were awed that you survived. From that brilliant instant when your world turned to fire and pain, you have had your shock of white hair and your cloudy “storm eye.” They serve as daily reminders of your survival despite a lightning bolt that seemingly singled you out. That you escaped death, perhaps death hurled by Kord, gave you courage. At first you lacked the strength to back up your bravery, but you persisted and endured the beatings, learning and becoming stronger until at last none would call you weakling or coward. You know now that if the lightning strike came from Kord, it was not his anger, but his blessing: a test that you passed with flying colors.
     Did you make any friends among those who once bullied you? Do any of the friends you had before the lightning strike resent the new you? Do you think the lightning strike was from Kord, or do you suspect a more mortal source? Does your storm eye have any special powers? </specific>

    <specific name="Common Knowledge"> They say you were born to serve Kord. Your birth occurred on a battlefield and during the worst storm in memory. Thunder heralded your arrival in the world, and when you took your first breath, the tempest and battle fell eerily silent as the eye of the storm—Kord’s eye—passed over you. Since then you were tutored and trained by warrior-scholars of Kord. For years, every moment of your waking hours was dedicated to preparing you for something: exercises, combat training, tactics and strategy, lessons about all the great conquerors, and the fighting techniques of a dozen nations. Then one day your teachers said you were ready; they had no more to teach you and you must seek to learn more in the wider world.
     Do you know for what your teachers were preparing you? Did they? Did your parents agree to give you over to the priests of Kord, or were you taken? What was the battle about when you were born? Do you believe yourself to be as important to Kord as those who taught you? </specific>

Serendipity favors you. You have long proved a constant and loyal servant to Avandra by making her interests your own in your ongoing struggle against tyranny and in your willingness to explore the world and sample all it has to offer. Your virtuous soul and good works have won you the goddess's favor, and although you know you were ever in her good graces, you realize you have only touched upon what is possible in her service.

Becoming fortune blessed makes luck your servant, yours to shape and manipulate as you desire. The goddess permits this mastery as long as you advance her aims in the world and remain pure of heart and purpose. You have a knack for husbanding your good fortune and turning setbacks to your advantage. The greater your power becomes, the more the impossible becomes possible until one day you find there is nothing you can't achieve with luck on your side.
