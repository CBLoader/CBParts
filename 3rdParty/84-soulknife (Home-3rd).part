	It starts when a young soulknife discovers strange talents. The psionic powers manifest naturally and he finds strange ways to manipulate the world through his mind. Perhaps a wandering master found him and taught him the way of shaping the blade from pure thought, but it is much more likely he had to approach it alone. The isolation from other psionic talents hardens the soul to be fit for a blade.

To be a soulknife is to be as razor sharp as the keenest sword. Only those of focused soul can meld it into the blade that's the trademark of this class. Ardents run wild with their emotions, Psions ponder over their books, and Battleminds work with mundane martial tools. The soulknife does none of these, instead working directly with tangible psionic energy.

A soulknife's mind weapon is a reflection of themselves. Most mind weapons take the form of heavy or light blades but they can show up in diverse colors and forms limited only by a soulknife's imagination. What they all have in common is an edge sharper than a dragon's tooth and substance harder than its scales. A mind weapon is a soulknife's biggest pride and biggest burden. Keeping one's soul hard enough to form a weapon requires a soul with rigidity and harshness that few can achieve without a price.

The mind weapon isn't the only manifestation of a soulknife's power. Like battleminds, soulknifes are constantly channeling psionic energy through their bodies. However, unlike battleminds, they turn that speed into a devastating offense rather than keeping any pretense of normal combat rules. This too has a cost for a soulknife. Most soulknives channel that energy so instinctively that they get jittery if forced to sit still for too long and often move with superhuman speed to accomplish even the most mundane of tasks.

Soulknives often are found as spies or assassins, as they carry a weapon anywhere they go. They tend to hide in plain sight until the moment is ready to strike. They generally possess a pride and showmanship that outdoes any other class. Some soulknives become wandering masters, seeking more of their own kind to foster. Still others sell their exquisite skills to the highest bidder, acting as elite soldiers in mercenary armies. They are found among all races, though the most numerous are humans, eladrin, shardminds, and githzerai.

		</rules>
Psionic energy can be formed into many different forms but a soulknife whose mind weapon takes the form of the Pure Blade dispenses with alterations to the pure psionic essence, preferring not to diffuse or corrupt its pure power and strength.  They strengthen their mind weapon with force of personality. Pure Blade soulknifes are often the most brash, pulling off dazzling feats of showmanship while fighting.  Their mind weapons often take the form of rapiers or other light blades. They also are adept at disguises and telling tall tales of their travels.  Still, like all soulknifes, they keep their souls disciplined, never letting their irreverence and pride weaken their resolve.

	Benefit: You deal extra psychic damage on all attacks using your mind weapons equal to your Charisma modifier.  This damage increases to your Charisma modifier +2 at 11th level and your Charisma modifier +4 at 21st level.  Also, when you score a critical hit with your mind weapon, the target is also dazed (save ends).

		</rules>
To be a Soulknife is to be disciplined but only those of the greatest focus are able to manifest the Weapon of Light.  Those soulknifes who can create the weapon of light are able to temper out every element from their mind weapons that would reduce their inner radiance and augment the pure psionic energy of their weapon with ambient light.   The soulknifes who can manifest the weapon of light move as fast as their more flashy peers, but instead of moving constantly wildly, they tend to make calculated bursts of speed.  They tend to favor more defensive powers and their mind weapons tend towards heavy blades.

	Benefit: You deal extra radiant damage on all attacks using your mind weapons equal to your Wisdom modifier.  This damage increases to your Wisdom modifier +2 at 11th level and your Wisdom modifier +4 at 21st level.  Also, when you score a critical hit with your mind weapon, the target is blinded (save ends).

		</rules>
In hushed tones and ancient texts, some young Soulknives discover tales of psychic warriors who gained great power by allowing thier souls to be fractured in two.  Through this secret technique, a Soulknife could focus on both primary and secondary attacks at once, as each half of the soul would be directing different movements.  While any Soulknife may decide to shape two soul weapons, the split-soul soulknife focuses on this technique above all others, refining it into a true art.  The turbulence from the divided energy of the soul pulling apart creates powerful force around the weapons of a split-soul soulknife.  When an enemy is exposed directly to the severed soul, it creates an opening for a fleet strike from the secondary soul guided off-hand weapon.
	Splitting one's soul is not without consequence, however.  A split-soul soulknife often switches between vastly different personalities as each half of the soul fights for dominance.  They are extremely volitile and chaotic and prone to extreme mood swings.  It is difficult for them to maintain much self-discipline and they tend to be even more impulsive than Pure Soul soulknifes.  Still, the power that they hold is undeniable, leading many to seek this path regardless of consequence.

	Benefit: You deal extra force damage on all attacks using your mind weapons equal to your Charisma modifier.  This damage increases to your Charisma modifier +2 at 11th level and your Charisma modifier +4 at 21st level.  Also, once per round, when you are wielding a melee weapon in each hand and you score a critical hit with your mind weapon, you may make a basic attack with your off-hand weapon as a free action.

The githyanki commander spotted the group of four adventurers approaching and gestured to his cohorts. The planar pirates swooped down upon the party, catching them by suprise and incapactating each one. Defeat seemed assured for the heoroes when all of a sudden a flash of light streaked accross the battlefield. The gith began falling, large bloody slashes on their bodies. The commander, realizing that he'd missed a fifth adventurer, tried to get a good look at the new assailant, but the mysterious combatant never slowed his movement down enough to catch even a glimpse. Soon, the battle was over. Only then did the blur slow down enough to see the grin on his face.
	All soulknifes possess speed beyond the normal mortal limits, but you have taken the art of swift combat to its very peak. You move so quickly that all anyone can see of you is the streaking glow of your soulsteel weapons. By the time the wounds you inflict on a foe begin to bleed you are generally already on the other side of the battle.

Most Soulknifes seem to be constantly in motion, striking quickly and wildly at the foes around them. However, there are Soulknifes who apply their speed in a much more measured manner. Calling themselves the Disciple of the Perfect Strike, these soulknifes believe in conserving momentum to deliver a single decisive blow rather than just striking faster than their foes. In combat, they often appear to be standing completely still while large gashes suddenly appear on their enemies. When struck at, they seem to suddenly be standing a foot to the left of where their opponents strike. They merely crack a wry smile at the frustration this causes their foes.
	The Disciples of the Perfect strike is an order without order. Often a soulknife will read a single text or witness a single battle with a master of the style and have to develop the technique completely on their own. The Disciples are almost exclusively comprised of Soulknifes who possess the Weapon of Light, as they have the patience to wait for the perfect moment to strike. They overwhelmingly favor disciplines that allow for a single, powerful or accurate attack and avoid disciplines which grant additional attacks which distract them from their purpose

While not all Soulknifes follow the path of the assassin, those who specialize in the stealthy kill have a special edge. The ability to effectively smuggle even large weapons into places where they would normally stand out gives Soulknifes a distinct advantage over other assassins. A typical psionic assassin approaches his target unarmed, performs the kill, then eludes capture through wits and the dissappearance of the murder weapon.
	Psionic assassins take this tradition a step farther. In a world where death is merely an inconvenience to some, the ability to kill not only the body but the mind can be very useful. A psionic assassin's strikes cut both body and mind, meaning that even if their victim is later raised from the dead, their mind may never recover.
	A psionic assassin is just as disciplined as other soulknifes and they display this discipline through meticulous selection of their marks. Employers have been frustrated many times by the independent and anarchical streaks of psionic assassins. Still, once a target has been assigned, a psionic assassin is unwavering in the mission and few are more resolute to achieve success.

Soldiers of a tyrannical king mercilessly beat back peasants as they take their meager crops and only food to feed the decadent ruler's court. A lightly armored figure suddenly steps forward out of the crowd and coolly asks the soldiers to desist. Laughing, the soldiers turn their weapons towards the unarmed stranger. Suddenly, glowing armor appears on the lone challenger as well as a brilliant shield and shining sword. He cuts through the oppressors in the blink of an eye. Their attempts to avoid him only seem to bolster his power and soon the remains of the soldiers are running back to the keep. When the peasants turn to thank the mysterious warrior, he has disappeared, along with his strange armaments.
	This is the path of the Soulsteel Knight, a psionic warrior who appears when least expected and disappears just as quickly. While he crafts mind weapons just like other Soulknifes, he has a rare sense of justice that leads him to take the unlikely path of defending the weak from those who would oppress them. Unlike a battlemind, he can go from being a fully armored knight one minute to being a lurk in the shadows the next. Soulsteel Knights often nurture the most disciplined of souls, as the mind stuff they create must not only be able to cut with deadly speed but also must serve as the shield for the weak.
	Most Soulsteel Knights come from those who follow the path of the Radiant Weapon, as they possess the mental discipline that allows them to most easily form defensive soulsteel. They tend to favor powers that give them defensive bonuses or allow them to retaliate against opponents. When they adventure in groups, they can often make up for the lack of a stronger and tougher warrior. Their sense of justice is often as rigid as their shields, so they often tend towards being Lawful Good, though they tend to avoid becoming part of larger societies, preferring to maintain their independence.

Most split soul soulknifes who recklessly undergo the process of splitting their soul to have it manifest in two specific parts end up with schizophrenic personalities as their divided soul conflicts and wars within them.  However, for those who seek true mastery over the split soul style, the two souls must regain some of their former harmony and the ability to work together.  Their souls are two equal and powerful parts that form together into a dedicated whole.
	The Twin Soul Masters have dedicated themselves to achieving this serenity.  Their soul weapons sing in perfect harmony as they work together to decimate their foes.    They seem to move with inhuman grace, seemingly aware of more than what thier senses could normally focus on.  While many are still boisterous and flamboyant, they move fluidly and swiftly.  Watching a true Twin Soul Master can be baffling, as often the two blades spin at such speed that it's hard to tell where one ends and the next begins.  This confounds their enemies and makes it almost certain that at least one blow will connect.
	While most Twin Soul Masters have the Weapon of the Split Soul, it's possible for soulknifes who manifest other mind weapons to follow this path.  By developing a strong sense of identity, they can temporarily split thier souls without fear of the chaos and neurosis that typically accompany the process.

Throughout your career as a Soulknife, you've gradually invested more and more of your essence in a tangible form through your Mind Weapon. While lesser Soulknifes only place a fraction of themselves into their weapon, you've crossed the threshold and now your soul resides more inside your weapon than in your body. In this way, you have begun a journey into becoming a living weapon; one of the mightiest in the world. Due to the investment you have placed in your Mind Weapon, you can unlock unique secrets that raise its power from mere tool to an entity rivaling the most powerful across the planes.

Immortality:
You slip past the mortal bounds of your body as you become a sentient manifestation of your psionic energy.

Ultimate Weapon:
As you complete the final task that your soul has been dedicated to, you are overcome with waves of power. Your body is destroyed as you channel the vast power of your soul fully into your Mind Weapon. You may have ceased to be as you were before, but your consciousness and drive live on. You have become a Soulforged Weapon, a unique sentient artifact that grants its wielder incredible power. Through choosing your wielders wisely, you can topple empires and gods and grant even the meekest of allies force enough to change the world. Many will seek to wield you, but only those you deem worthy to your goals will be able to harness your power. In this way, you continue to forever fight and work for your beliefs.

		<specific name="Effect"> Your body and equipment merge into your Mind Weapon, which flies to the hand of the target. It continues to exist for this purpose as long as the target wields it. The target can stow one weapon they are holding as a free action before grabbing the weapon. Your mind weapon takes the form of any weapon of your ally's choice and provides a +6 enhancement bonus to attack and damage rolls.
Until the end of the encounter or until the target is no longer wielding the weapon, they gain all benefits while attacking with the weapon that you gain while specifically using your Mind Weapon (i.e. +2 to attack rolls, 1d10 extra damage on a hit, ignore all immunities and resistances, extra damage from your Mind Weapon class feature, etc.). They do not gain the benefits of effects that do not specifically reference your Mind Weapon or your Shape Mind Weapon power.
Once per round, as a minor action, while wielding the weapon, the target may grant you a standard action which you can use to attack through them as if you were attacking normally (you use your own statistics, powers, equipment and power points). Any effects on you don't affect you for this action, but effects on the target affect you.
At the end of the encounter, all effects of this power end and your Soul Energy reforms your equipment and body at full hit points.

When your body dies, your soul is shocked into unlocking your future potential as a sentient weapon. Your soul briefly deserts your body to reside in your mind weapon which provides an ally a taste of the power you will grant once your epic destiny is complete.
