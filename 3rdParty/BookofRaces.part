    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Avians resemble humanoid flightless eagles, although with the appropriate feat and maturation they do gain flight. They are coated in feathers and possess a sharp, yellow beak. They are human sized but tend to be lighter than humans due to their internal makeup. Their feet are lide claws and Avians sport a broad, feathered tail. Their head is birdlike, usually with coloration similar to a bald eagle. Long feathers extend down from their arms, but they cannot accurately be called wings. Their hands are Elven in appearance.
	  Avian eyes can be yellow, green, red, gray, black, or blue and are deep-set. Their feathers are usually brown, golden, white, gray, or black but an Avian's head feathering is usually a different color than those coating his body. The feathers hanging down from their arms are quite large, as are the feathers of their tails. Their beak is generally yellow with a sharp hook at the end. Avians are typically broad of chest and thigh, with a skinny waist and thin knees.
	  Avians are not mammals, and they are hatched from eggs. They grow faster than humans do, reaching maturity in about 10 years. They tend to live as long as humans. In old age their feathers become grayer and frazzled looking. Avians walk upright, but occasionally may hop to a place they want to be. Their voices are birdlike. They can swim excellently. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> Most Avians grow up with their tribes. Avians spend the initial portion of their lives living in villages amongst the tree-tops. They usually return to village life when old-age is upon them. During most their adult years, Avians can be found living a nomadic existence, travelling in groups of various size. Amongst the plains Avians live in teepees, while in the forests Avians prefer temporary shelter in the branches. In the north, Avian tribes dwell in igloos as they roam the tundra.
	  Life in the wilds is very dangerous. Monsters of all sorts roam about, ready to rend chicks and decimate a tribe. Therefore, Avians rely heavily on ritual magic to keep their campsites secure. Avians participate from an early age in a wide assortment of magic rituals. Most are designed to keep out unwanted enemies or hide the tribes' whereabouts from those nearby. Mystics often query the forces of nature on how to best proceed with a course of action. An Avians life is often liberally sprinkled with combative encounters. Avian tribal groups are well organized and are adept at fighting and magic. Woe is any who strive to defeat them.
	  Honor and integrity are very important to Avians. They tend to lie much less often than other races. An Avian is keenly aware of how people work. They can easily see what motivates others. Their tribal stories often go into detail about the reasoning of their heroes and villains. It is these stories which provide Avians with a diverse history of the lands they dwell within. Nearly every night another story is told amongst the tribe, to dwell upon as they slumber. Some are legendary arcs of heroism, while others are short fables with distinct morals to learn from. Avians have tighter racial bonds than Nymphs or Vixen.
	  Avian adventurers tend to be those who have left their tribes for life in the towns and cities of other races. Some have been ejected from the tribe, some are working for the tribe, and others leave to chase after their own pursuits. Avians are fine companions. Their word may be short but they are very potent. Friendship with an Avian is based upon mutual respect. They are adept at rituals and the ways of nature and are a welcome addition to most any adventuring group.</specific>

    <specific name="Characteristics"> Intimidating, large, wise, strong, good-natured, tough, focused </specific>
    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Bjorn are large, bipedal ursines, who resemble bears in appearance. they are covered in fur and possess sharp fangs and a muzzle. They tend to be very strong and usually have a deep, resonant voice. They have a very short tail.
	  Their fur comes in white, brown, and black varieties and their nose is typically, black or pink. Eye color is generally black, brown, blue, gray, yellow, or red. A Bjorn has very sharp claws on both its feet and its hands. 
	  Bjorn have the ability to hibernate for extended lperiods of time, if desired. During hibernation they neither need to eat nor drink. They are generally lethargic duting this time and mostly oblivious to events happening around them, though they can readily awaken if disturbed. 
	  Bjorn are typically excellent swimmers and can climb well. Their main forte is physical combat. Possessing stronger bodies than most the other races, they excel at grappling, and are very fearsome to go up against. Some Bjorn have such a thick hide that ranged attacks occasionally bounce off them. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> Bjorn are a race known to be both gentle and ferocious. Their enemies find them frightening and view them as very difficult apponents. Bjorn also develop deep bonds of friendship. They can go to great lengths to assist those they trust. Many Bjorn also acquire a seasoned wisdom and Bjorn mystics are not unknown. 
	  Bjorn tend to value ties to nature above ties to the gods. While various Bjorn states exist, they are more commonly associated with being more solo in nature, living with their families in the wilds or above their blacksmith shops in town. Bjorn of the sea are more rare, though they are quite prevalent in artic regions.
	  Bjorn tend to be slow to anger, but once riled up, they generally focus upon that which has disturbed them. Bjorn are generally good natured, but their impressive appearance, and reputation for fierceness often makes others wary of offending a Bjorn. Bjorn laughter has a way of putting everyone at ease though.
	  Bjorn tend to mate for life. Family ties tend to be stronger than those to their country or state. While Bjorn value their children greatly, others view their lessons as often being overly harsh. Bjorn children are adored, but not spoiled.</specific>

	  When an Excelsion woman is pregnant, her thoughts and ideas about her baby influences how the child shall develop. If she primarily imagines her son as an acrobat, the child usually shall be attracted to gymnastic activities and have a proclivity to succeed in feats of dexterity. If instead she envisions her child becoming a great alchemist or wizard, they might be predisposed to succeed in more intellectual areas.  The thoughts of a pregnant Excelsion greatly influence the characteristics of her offspring.
	  Excelsions age at the same rate as humans. They generally live to be around 120 years of age. Most Excelsions are physically fit. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> Excelsions are concerned with genealogy. They research the feats of their ancestors and contemplate the future of their children. In the great cities of the world, Excelsions keep detailed repositories of their genealogical information. Most Excelsions periodically send in the highlights of their regular life and that of their immediate family. Keeping such records is quite important to Excelsions.
	  No Excelsion is great at everything. But, usually one can find Excelsions amongst the top of the various professions. There are great Excelsion warlords and wizards, rogues and shaman. Excelsions love the bardic classes and, if they are not bards themselves, they usually befriend bards in order for their tales to be told and passed along.
	  It is rumored that the Excelsion race was purposely planned when it was created. And it is suspected that Excelsions have a racial strategy extending out for millennia.
	  Excelsions are a race prone to contemplation and reflection. There is knowledge and wisdom to be gained from reviewing the past, thinking of the present, and considering the future. Excelsions tend to choose mates of their own race, but they are typically found in the company of an assortment of friends from all races. Excelsions can be found in most all walks of life. </specific>

    <specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
    <specific name="Characteristics"> Alien, unusual, unique, smart, eloquent, strong, durable, quizzical, industrious </specific>
    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Insectoids are bipedal insects the size of humans. They have two arms and two legs, walk upright, and their skin is a chitinous exoskeleton. Their eyes are compound and multi-faceted and they have a pair of antennae on top of their heads.
	  Insectoids have a wide variety of appearances. There are types resembling ants, bees (sans wings), and mantises, but there are neither arachnid forms, nor those similar to scorpions. Their bodies are narrow-waisted between the thorax and the abdomen.
	  Insectoid chitin is typically black, brown, gray, red, orange, green, or even white. Many Insectoids possess a shimmering sheen of iridescence on their chitin. Insectoid antennae come in a wide variety of shapes, with some being short and solid, while others are long and feathery. Insectoids don't have hair on their heads, but some have longer, sparse hair sprouting from points on their bodies.
	  Insectoids are adept at leverage and can lift extraordinary amounts. Their movements appear somewhat mechanical and their hands are vaguely human in shape. Many Insectoids can communicate telepathically with each other. Some Insectoids are able to metamorphose and sprout wings in later life. Insectoid voices sound alien, but they are eloquent.
	  Insectoids hatch from eggs laid by a queen and rapidly progress through the pupae stage to adulthood. Most Insectoids have no family ties except to their queen. They tend to live about as long as humans. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> Insectoids are also known as Opterans, which is what they call themselves. They have large colonies and hives scattered throughout the natural world, Feywild, and Shadowfell, both above ground and below. While prevalent in the Underdark, they are most noted for their empires in the Feywild.
	  Insectoids are generally very community oriented. They tend to value the needs of society over their own personal goals. Their devotion to their matriarch tends to be supreme. Yet, Insectoid adventurers are generally the ones outside the norm of Insectoid existence. They have chosen individuality over generic communal life. An Insectoid adventurer strives more than most to be unique and to stand out. It is typically these unusual Insectoid individuals who rise to lead their hives as queen or consort.
	  Insectoid society is typically strictly divided into castes. Each Insectoid has their place in the community. But life is not all work and duty. Each Opteran has some limited free time to devote to their hobbies. Insectoids found in the cities of other races are generally working for the good of their home hive. Insectoids tend to group together with each other, more so than other races such as Half-Elves or Leonines.
	  Insectoid adventurers have broken out of the caste system. They do not actively seek out other Opterans. Instead they tend to search for truth and wisdom through worldly experience. Due to their upbringing, Insectoids can make noteworthy diplomats. They consider their words carefully and are excellent orators. </specific>

The Mind Mage is a form of Psionicist. They possess limited telepathy and can attack with their mind. Mind Mages are not powered by Arcane sources but instead use the power of their intellect to damage their enemies.
The Mind Mage typically spends a significant amount of time in contemplation honing their inner skills and abilities. They might travel to various towers and sanctuaries of learning and wisdom. Mind Mages typically are happy to encounter one another as they are eager to share their latest enlightenments with others of their kind.
Mind Mages have a loose fraternity throughout the natural world and the Feywild. When in trouble, they are pledged to provide shelter and assistance to each other.

Eye color rages from white, yellow, green, blue, orange, red, pink, silver, gray, and purple, to gold.
	  Leonine bodies are covered in a soft downy fur, which is very short and almost unnoticeable. Fur colors can range from pink, white, yellow, gray, black, and silver, to gold. Leonine ears are slightly pointed. They do not possess a tail.
	  Leonine physiques are typically very extraordinary their muscles bulge and their bosoms swell quite provocatively. They possess a great, thick mane of hair, with a wide variety of colors.

Most appear to be in their 20's even when over 200 years old. Only a few Leonines who have magically extended their life appear to be over 30. Normally, after 200-300 years, a Leonine's spark of life fades away and they quickly perish. They are not truly immortal.

	  Leonine attitude is typically that of hearty camaraderie. They excel at assisting others and believe strongly that favors should be returned. Many Leonines are religious, and they often choose the path of the Paladin. Leonines understand that a person's worth comes from their actions, not their appearance.
	  Leonines game a passion for living. They relish their lot in life, even if it is simple farming. A job well done and a close group of friends are all one needs to live a happy existence. Leonines tend to live life without stress. Those who rise to notoriety often claim to only be doing what needs to be done.

The Conqueror is an armored hero, usually the leader of a regiment. He stands out as a beacon of might amongst the troops. Conquerors often serve states, kingdoms, and organizations but can also strike out on their own, with only their close comrades as support.
A Conqueror excels at martial combat and thrives in the battlefield. Outside of battle, duties include planning for supplies, strategies, and tactics to employ based upon their current adversary and local conditions. A hood Conqueror is always prepared and keeps sufficient capabilities in reserve to call upon when there is need.
A Conqueror's life is centered on a military existence. They must sometimes deal with politics, but they try to avoid such entanglements. They are not above disposing of corrupt officials, if needed.

    <specific name="Characteristics"> Small, mischievous, annoying, happy, unnoticeable, stealthy sneaky, wise, chaotic </specific>
    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Ling are small, fey creatures. They are quite spry and due to their fey origins, they are a bit mystical as will. Ling are the original progenitors of the Halfling race. When a Ling and a Human reproduce, a Halfling is the product, though the Halflings have bred true and become their own race over the years.
	  Ling are even smaller than Halflings. They have pointed ears and the tops of their feet are quite hairy, though they generally wear shoes and cover up this trait. Their hair is quite full, and can be intricately styled. Male Ling often grow beards of various styles when they are older.
	  Skin color ranges from white, pink, gray, green, brown, and orange, to yellowish. Hair colors can be white, brown, black, blue, yellow, green, purple and red. In old age, male Ling usually have gray hair and beards. Ling have eyes of every color.
	  Ling can be difficult to focus upon and are naturally stealthy. They often prefer to position themselves behind things to have some cover. Ling can even cause others to lose interest in them, and not even notice that they are around.
	  Ling typically live to be around 150 years old. They age at the same rate as humans, but generally do not appear to be over 70. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> Ling are a mischievous lot. They take great pleasure in trickery and teasing their compatriots and random others. Usually there is no ill-will involved. It is just a Ling's way of having fun and being accepting of their friends. Most of the tricks are quite harmless, but others can find them annoying.
	  Ling are distantly related to Leprechauns, Brownies, and Tomte. They don't have their own empires in the Feywild or natural world, but there are Ling villages and small towns, scattered about. Ling love to relax but they also frequently exhibit bursts of energy. Ling are very fond of riddles.
	  Ling are equally comfortable both with mixing amongst other races and being on their own. They really enjoy meeting new people and interacting with others in a playful fashion. They like to acknowledge wisdom in others, typically by rewarding those they find worthy with boons from correctly answering riddles they pose.
	  Ling are not prolific and typically only reproduce once or twice in their lifetime. They lack the numbers and cohesion to become a strong force in the world, yet what they lack in quantity, they make up for in chaos. Ling mechanisms often alter the path of events and empires. Whether this is purposeful is open for debate. </specific>

The Trickster has been featured in many fairy tales. They often prey upon the vain and torment them in various fashions. If you can answer their Riddle they shall leave you in peace and may even help you. The Riddle is often a trick, though, and doom falls upon those unable to guess its Answer.
Tricksters are quite sneaky and furtive. They enjoy causing chaos but do not like to be seen or be the focus of attention. Bouncing around the battlefield causing confusion is their forte. Pilfering interesting items is also quite typical of a Trickster. Tricksters delight in flummoxing their foes.

    <specific name="Characteristics"> Beautiful, alluring, aquatic, seductiove, flighty, happy-go-lucky, sexy, good </specific>
    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Nymphs are slightly smaller than humans. There are ONLY female Nymphs. No natural males of the species exist. Nymphs are quite beautiful and are fey in appearance. They have pointed ears and long billowy hair.
	  A Nymph is attuned to the water, but primarily exists on land. They can swim excellently and are able to breathe and function underwater with no difficulties.
	  Nymphs are typically blue colored, but their skin can be green, yellow, or gray as well. Hair color can be blue, green, yellow, red, or orange. They have eyes of all colors.
	  A Nymphs skin is usually damp to the touch, but their bodies are warm and inviting. Their voices are mesmerizing in their beauty. Many males dream of having a Nymph girlfriend. They do not have scales.
	  Nymphs age at the same rate as humans until they are adults, then Nymphs stay young and radiant looking until they die at around 150 years of age.</specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> Nymphs are unable to reproduce amongst themselves. Luckily a small percentage of males of other races are able to procreate with Nymphs. While a Nymph could use magic to determine which male might actually be able to create a baby, what fun is there in that? Nymphs prefer to sample selected males of other races until they find one which can actually reproduce with them. Nymph babies are always female Nymphs, regardless of the father's race.
	  Nymphs do not form nations on their own, yet many of the most notable empires in history have had a Nymph mistress as a power behind the throne. Nymphs are often found alone by lakes or streams, or seen playing with a small group of other Nymph friends.
	  Nymphs can occasionally be frivolous and sometimes others view them as flighty. In reality, Nymphs have the wisdom to understand that life is for fun and some things other races find very serious are not conducive to that primary purpose of life.
	  Nymphs are adept at enticing others to do things for them. Most don't realize they are being manipulated and think their actions were their own idea. A Nymph is not above using her beauty and charisma to make things easier for herself. Still, a Nymphs heart is pure, and she can perform heroic actions to assist those she cares about. Nymphs make excellent comrades and compatriots. They often choose to go about things in a different manner than the straightforward fashion of a Dwarf or Dragonborn. </specific>

The Seductress is a type of Nymph who specializes in charm and seduction. They are typically extremely attractive and use their beauty to coerce others into helping the Nymph and doing as she desires.
The voice of a Seductress is quite magical and alluring. Those who hear her song are often entranced by her plight. A Seductress naturally instills a desire to protect and assist her. Many renowned feats in history have been performed to win the affection of a Seductress.
A Seductress typically never loves a single person for long, and her passion is fickle. While she is true to her friends, she is always seeking a more fulfilling love to quench her burning heart.

    <specific name="Characteristics"> Honorable, friendly, unique, tough, intelligent, freedom loving, trustworthy </specific>
    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Obsidians are humanoids who appear to be made out of hard, black glass rock. Their skin is solid and can have some sharp edges in places. They can be colored either black, dark green or deep brown. Obsidians with a golden sheen to their flesh are known as Sheen Obsidians. Some Obsidians have embedded white regions about the size of snowflakes. These Obsidians are known as Snowflake Obsidians.
	  Obsidians move fluidly, even though their body seems to be quite hard. Their eyes can be white, black, red, blue, green, yellow, or purple and are typically pupil-less. Their tongues are red or black, and their teeth are either like black obsidian or white. Obsidians are warm to the touch.
	  Male Obsidians are typically bald. Females can have hair like fine, spun glass. Hair color can be black, white, deep blue, dark purple, deep green, or gray.
	  Obsidians are typically quite healthy. They age at about the same rate as humans and generally live to be about 120. Their skin does not wrinkle as they get old, but it does develop fine cracks over time. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> Obsidians are native to the Shadowfell, where they dwell amongst the mountaintops. They generally live in tunnels and fortifications carved out of solid rock. There are few Obsidian communities in the natural world.
	  The Shadowfell is full of deceit, danger, and dishonor. Obsidian adventurers found in the natural world are those free-spirits who chose to leave their native plane and seek a more honorable life away from home. Thus, obsidians encountered are typically quite friendly, and eager to meet new friends and experience life. Their connections to family and community are usually far behind and distant. They are creating a new life as they live.
	  Obsidians are fairly rare, and can usually be found in the cities and Dwarven communities of the world. Dwarves tend to recognize a kindred spirit in Obsidians and value the integrity and friendship they provide. 
	  Obsidians relish being rare and enjoy the opportunity to be unique and stand out in the world. They strive to make an honorable name for their kind and conduct themselves with pure intent. Some settle down, while others venture out and search for enlightenment. Obsidians are drawn to mystical martial arts, as well as the magical paths and mental pursuits. </specific>

The Dark Shard is a individual who fully utilizes his body makeup. Their flesh becomes very hard and sharp and those touching them are prone to bleed. They are unable to wear non-magical clothing of cloth, leather, or hide and must stick to metal or magical armor which can withstand their sharp body.
The Dark Shard can unleash a torrent of magical black glass slivers against their enemies.
The life of the Dark Shard is often lonely. Other races are unable to withstand physical contact with a Dark Shard, so they usually search for peace and tranquility in their surroundings. Friendships can make up for lack of intimacy.

    <specific name="Characteristics"> Honorable, valiant, fair, inspiring, courageous, righteous, golden, just, warm </specific>
    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Radiantss are charismatic, metal-skinned humanoids from the Astral Sea. Their skin is usually golden, but can also appear to be made or silver (chrome) or bronze.
	  Radiantss have solid colored ocular organs without pupils. Eyes can be most any color; some exceptional Radiantss even have eyes that slightly glow.
	  Radiantss can have full, thick hair which often appears metallic as well. Many male Radiantss are completely bald. Hair colors can be gold, silver, copper, red, black, white, yellow, blue, purple, blue and more. They have no body hair.
	  Radiants flesh is warm to the touch. They move very gracefully and confidently. If a Radiants is cut, the wound can also bleed a slight amount of light, thought this is typically only noticeable in the dark.
	  Radiantss grow to adulthood at a slightly slower rate than humans. Once they are adults, they age very slowly. Although Radiantss originated in the Astral Sea they are not truly immortal. They usually have a lifespan of around 250 years. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> Radiantss are a virtuous race with a strong connection to the plane of the gods. They strive to be valiant and often feel filled with righteousness. Many are drawn to the life of a Paladin. Most believe it is the duty of everyone to deliver justice and maintain balance and fairness.
	  Radiantss strive for excellence in their chosen fields, hobbies, and endeavors. This is different from the drive to perfection a Ferralyn might feel. To a Radiants, it is not perfection which is the goal; rather it is distinction and merit which is the key. To excel beyond the norm is a driving force behind many of the actions and habits of Radiantss.
	  Like many races, Radiantss might believe they are superior to others, yet they are not condescending towards them. They understand that each race has their own strengths and weaknesses. All are to be valued, and diversity amongst compatriots helps strengthen the entire group.
	  Radiantss make powerful looking figures. To have a Radiants on ones side usually makes one feel safer and more secure. Their stature, bearing, and actions can easily inspire confidence in their allies. Often the phrases uttered by a Radiants can be deeply meaningful. They have a keen insight into life and can be quite philosophical. </specific>

The Angelic path is the true path to immortality. Those pure of spirit and purpose can sometimes rise up and begin the process of the angelic transformation. Their spark of life has been kindled and blossomed rather than fading away.
Angelics tend to serve the causes of justice and truth. They need not be exceedingly religious, just unusually devoted to their ideals and focused in their actions. 
Others can sometimes view Angelics with awe and reverence. But they are not true Angels yet, just notable people who are pure of heart and at balance within themselves. They have flaws like any other, but many people tend to overlook their defects and focus on their integrity and noble characteristics.
Some gods and religions like to entrust important ungertakings to Angelics. These quests and tasks tend to be quite difficult.

They typically sport long hair on top of their heads and have the ability to make this hair appear to move in a breeze, even when indoors. Hair color can be almost any hue, as can their eyes. Some powerful Storm Elves have been seen to have small flashes of lightning around their eyes when they are excited. 
	  Storm Elves have the agility of the other elves, but add in strength not found in their brethren. They age at a much slower rate than humans and generally live at least 200 years. 
	  Storm Elves are very light of foot. Their movements are light and airy and appear to be mystically enhanced. Some say they can jump from cloud to cloud. Their skin colors are typically pink, yellow, tan, white, blue, or gray. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> Storm Elves are sometimes known as Sky Elves. They are found high in the mountains of the Feywild and natural world. They are most at home within the clouds and storms surrounding their abodes.
	  Storm Elves are a passionate race. Their emotions are easily brought out and are more difficult to control than for other races. They are quick to anger yet can swiftly fall deeply in love. Such emotional creatures are sometimes problematic to be around, but their friends value the fact that Storm Elf friendships run deep and they are not often deceitful, as their emotions tend to give away their intentions.
	  Storm Elf societies are generally found far up in large mountain ranges. They share such space with the Dwarves and the occasional Obsidian, but all three races tend to get along with each other and play upon the strengths of each race for mutual benefit. Their main festivals are timed to occur at the height of hurricane or monsoon season. 
	  Storm Elves are found in most all professions, though they are more attracted to the natural paths instead of an urban lifestyle. They tend to have greater faith in their own inner strength rather than relying upon the strengths of others, yet they highly value interracial friendships and are generally found amongst a tight group of friends. </specific>

    <Flavor> Intelligent and agile primates full of energy and exuberance. </Flavor>
    <specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>
    <specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
    <specific name="Characteristics"> Agile, intelligent, happy, perceptive, energetic, patient, friendly </specific>
    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Tarsions are slightly smaller than humans. They are covered in short, fuzzy fur, and possess a long tufted tail. Their enormous eyes are their most striking feature. Eye colors can include shades of blue, yellow, red, orange, purple, green, gray, and others. Their thick fur is generally gray, brown, yellow, blue, or orange and is usually one primary color with lighter regions around the chest and end of the tail. Tarsions have large, rounded ears on top of their heads. 
	  Tarsions tend to be slim and wiry with a slightly barrel like chest. Their heads can rotate nearly 180 degrees, though their eyes are unable to look left or right. Tarsions are a very acrobatic race and are adept at making long leaps. Some Tarsions are known to be able to sleep with one eye open. Their tail is not prehensile. 
	  Tarsion children age similar to humans but, once in their mid-teens, their aging slows dramatically. Tarsions tend to stay young looking for hundreds of years, and then swiftly fly through middle-age. Old-age can last another hundred years or so, yet even old Tarsions are quite spry. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> Tarsions are a happy race, known for their intellectual pursuits. They descended from nocturnal, arboreal, primates and can now be found scattered all about. Tarsions tend to be quite individualistic and, except for their family, generally make their homes separate from other Tarsions. As such, Tarsions seldom form nations, or cities consisting primarily of Tarsions. Instead, they blend in with existing communities or dwell solo, away from urban environments. 
	  Tarsions are intelligent, agile, and very perceptive. They are long-lived and typically appear very upbeat and energetic. For sports, they tend to enjoy solo pursuits such as martial arts, gymnastics, and swimming, instead of traditional team activities. Tarsions also have many intellectual pursuits as well and can be found as scientists, historians, and investigators of magical and psionic research. Tarsions value their friendships highly and often favor their friends over other allegiances. They are easily entertained and are generally hard to upset. Tarsions often strive for integrity and appreciate uniqueness. They mate for life and infidelity is unknown. Their partially nocturnal nature makes them ill-suited for farming but well adapted to keeping watch or performing in a band. Tarsions can be found amongst the ranks of monks and politicians, professors and currency traders. They are quite adaptable but are not prolific. </specific>

    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Vixens look like humanoid foxes. They are covered in luxurious fur and have a full, bushy tail. Their coat is typically reddish blending to a white front, but can be colored white, orange, yellow, brown, or black. 
	  They have large ears on the top of their heads and some have long whickers. The end of their noses can be either black or pink in color. Vixens have eyes of every hue and typically have long lashes. 
	  Most Vixens have a full mane of hair, which is usually a different color from their coat. Though many Vulpine only have short fur on their heads, similar to the rest of their body. Vixens have tiny, sharp teeth and small claws on their fingers. 
	  Vixens tend to be quite attractive to other races. They have the ability to produce half-breed babies with many races, but these babies are sterile and do not breed true. Vixen age at about the same rate as humans and they live to be around 90 years of age. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> Vixen and Vulpine are the same race, with the females being referred to as Vixen and the males described as Vulpine. It is the females of the race that are most notable and are generally what one thinks of first when imagining the species. 
	  Vixen are a mystical race, known to be very wise and cunning. They are quite crafty and are adept at creating distractions and machinations, though usually there are for pure purposes and not evil schemes. They can outwit many of their opponents and possess a keen insight into the workings of mankind.
	  Vixen are hopeless romantics and typically focus on one relationship for many years at a time, thought it may take a while to find their true love. Powerful Vixen who pursue the Kitsune path can even change appearance to another race for years on end to please their mate. 
	  Vixen are generally found in the company of other races and tend not to associate too much with members of their own species. They are somewhat territorial when it comes to their friends and abodes. Vixen are very loyal and reward those who are true to them, but they can be quite vengeful when they are wronged. 
	  Sehanine is the most popular goddess amongst Vixen. They are often found as clerics working for her cause. Vixen are also prone to travel and make excellent bards. Their love of nature entices many to the paths of ranger and druid. Though overall, Vixen can be found in most any profession. They can see the folly of bad choices much earlier than most and generally lead content lives. </specific>

Kitsune are very spiritual Vixens with mystical capabilities. Most are female, thought there are a few Vulpines who pursue this path as well. Due to their divine bent, Kitsune are often used by some gods for various tasks such as temple guarding and quest fulfillment.
Kitsune dream of finding a perfect partner. They care not what species he is from, as long as his heart is pure. They adjust their form to fit his species, though they often retain fox-like traits. They can have children through these unions that are the same race as the father. The children often develop an affinity for the mystical fields.
Kitsune possess the wisdom to be happy and content in their lives. They understand what is most important.

    <specific name="Characteristics"> Strong, sturdy, reliable, big stalwart, slow, unusual, unstoppable </specific>
    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Volems are sentient golems of various substances. There are 6 main types of Volems, though alternate forms do exist. Volems can be made of rock, flesh, mud, crystal, wood, or metal. While each is different in appearance and make up, they are part of the same race and share certain characteristics.
	  Volems are typically slow and sturdy. They are also strong, and healthy. If they are damaged they do not bleed (except fleshbody Volems). Woodbody Volems bleed sap. Volems have an inner spark of life which resides near their stomach region. They are actually Living Constructs and don't need to eat, drink, or breathe. After becoming adults they no longer show signs of age.
	  Volems have no sex, though most are male in appearance. Each Volem has the ability to reproduce on its own. They can withdraw a portion of their spark of life and it develops into a new baby Volem. The element the baby Volem is primarily exposed to determines what of Volem it becomes. So a baby that lives underground in a cave is likely to grow into a rockbody Volem though it may become a crystalbody Volem if it plays extensively with gems or crystals found in the cavern.
	  Volems vary greatly in appearance, even amongst those with the same material essence. They have a wide assortment of colors and physiques. Most Volems have red glowing eyes, though metalbody Volems have a partially mirrored shell covering much of their face.
	  Woodbody Volems are made of wood, and can resemble small Treants, of chiseled wooden constructs. Rockbody Volems are made of rock and might appear to be formed from marble, granite, or stone. Mudbody Volems are rounded and made of firm mud, though they can soften themselves when needed. Fleshbody Volems are made of pink flesh, sometimes with a pieced together appearance. They tend to feel less pain that others when damaged. The metalbody Volems are all made of various metals. They do not rust. Some look like chrome, while others are iron or copper. And crystalbody Volems are made of crystals in various color and forms. Unlike the other Volems, they can move fairly quickly and are not slow.
	  Volems typically live around 500-800 years before their spark of life fades away. They have deep, resonant voices and are warm to the touch. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing">Volems were initially formed out of golem constructs and servants, long age. An Eidolon named Strengart achieved godhood and needed worshippers. He bestowed sentience and volition to the masses of golems serving in an ancient doppelganger empire. The Volems rebelled against their former controllers and grew over time to develop their own realms and cultures. Long ago their godling, Strengart, was stripped of his godhood and perished. The Volem race remains as his legacy.
	  Volems live a very long life and many can remember everything which happens to them, if they try. As such, older Volems have a wide assortment of skills and abilities. Volems tend to be very patient, and can be content standing in one place doing nothing but thinking. They have a full range of emotions and can feel anger, love, sadness, and joy.

The Magnetist makes use of his metallic structure to control the elemental power of magnetism. He is adept at moving enemies around the battlefield, regardless of if they are wearing iron or make of metal. Elemental magnetism works against all creatures.
Many Magnetists develop distinct personalities. They tend to have many quirks. They are typically not dull to be around and are very outgoing. A common trick is to pull a flagon of ale down the length of the bar to their hand. Just because they don't drink, does not mean it is not fun to do so in a social situation.
Magnetists tend to enjoy electrical and lightning items and effects and are most comfortable in extreme cold. Magnetists have an affinity for gadgets.
