    <specific name="Role"> Leader. You channel arcane power into items that empower your allies and hinder your enemies. You lean toward controller as a secondary role. </specific>
    <specific name="Power Source"> Arcane. The cryptic formulas of arcane magic and the complex recipes of alchemy appeal to you. You are especially knowledgeable about magic items. </specific>
    <specific name="Creating"> Three artificer builds are presented here: the battlesmith, the tinkerer, and the warrior forge artificer. The tinkerer creates arcane constructs, the battlesmith infuses weapons and armor with magic, and the warrior forge artificer attacks from a distance with ranged weapons and implement attacks. All artificers rely on Intelligence to create and control their spells. In addition, Wisdom helps you animate constructs, while Constitution focuses your magic in nonanimate items. </specific>
    <specific name="Class Features"> You have the following class features. </specific>
    <specific name="Supplemental"> RITUAL BOOK
You own a ritual book, and it contains the following rituals that you have mastered: Brew Potion, Disenchant Magic Item, Enchant Magic Item, and Make Whole. In addition, you can use Disenchant Magic Item without expending components. </specific>
    <specific name="Implement"> Artificers make use of rods, staffs, and wands to help channel and direct their arcane powers. Without an implement, an artificer can still use artificer powers, including those that have the implement keyword. An artificer wielding a magic rod, staff, or wand can add its enhancement bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls of artificer powers, as well as artificer paragon path powers, that have the implement keyword.

Some artificer powers have the weapon keyword and often require a  ranged weapon. If the ranged weapon fires ammunition, the ammunition carries the power's effect. Otherwise, the weapon carries the effect. When the attack is made, a mundane weapon returns to the artificer like a magic thrown weapon does. </specific>
    <specific name="Powers"> Your arcane powers are called spells, though many artificers refer to spells that instill magic in objects as “infusions.” The powers here also introduce a new keyword: artifice.
	Artifice: An artifice is an object that consists of inanimate materials that are infused with and animated by magic. It does not occupy a square unless a power states otherwise. As a minor action, you can make your artifice move a number of squares equal to your Constitution modifier, or you can shift it 1 square. The artifice's defenses equal your level + 4,and it has hit points equal to your healing surge value. If an artifice drops to 0 hit points or is consumed, it is destroyed. If the effect an artifice creates ends without the artifice being destroyed, the artifice reverts to its inert form. You can reuse an artifice that has reverted to its inert form. </specific>

Artificers treat mastery of magic like a technical skill. They see patterns in energy and matter, and they understand how to manipulate the flow of magic in and around objects and creatures. Artificers channel energy into items using magical components, diagrams, and complex chains of sigils. Their skills let them assemble a magic device for any situation. 

As an artificer, you might be a formal student of magic who became interested in artifacts and arcane items. Alternatively, you could be a tinkerer who devised magic tools in a musty basement. Or perhaps you are an explorer who found your knowledge in the forgotten places of the world. Whatever the source of your talents, a passion for the technical components of magic drives you to perfect your art. 

With a bandolier slung across your chest, you carry an arsenal of alchemical compounds, magic implements, mundane materials, and tools. Your weapons, implements, and other gear are inscribed with runes and mystic patterns. You mix reagents, drink potions, and craft items. You use your knowledge to infuse yourself and your allies with arcane power. And one day, your magical skills will carry you into legend.

Maelbrathyr is home to unique artisans, armorsmiths, and weaponsmiths. Many of them have trained as artificers to create special arms and armor. Inevitably, some of these craftspeople experimented with the shadowy forces at play in the forsaken city, imbuing their creations with a dark energy.
