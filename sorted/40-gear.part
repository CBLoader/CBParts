Properties: 
Defensive (A defensive weapon grants you a +1 bonus to AC while you wield the defensive weapon in one hand and wield another melee weapon in your other hand.

The blade of this heavy knife curves forward for greater potency. A rogue proficient with the kukri can treat it as a dagger for the purpose of the Rogue Weapon Talent class feature.

Properties: 
Off-Hand (An off-hand weapon is light enough that you can hold it and attack effectively with it while holding a weapon in your main hand. You can't attack with both weapons in the same turn, unless you have a power that lets you do so, but you can attack with either weapon.).
Brutal 1 (A brutal weapon's minimum damage is higher than that of a normal weapon.

Reroll the die until the value shown exceeds the weapon's brutal value, and then use the new value.).

When you perform the ritual, you describe the desired construction in great detail. The hands start working as soon as they appear, assembling the structure from available material. They will quarry stone and cut it to shape, fell trees and saw them into lumber, gather reeds for thatch, and so on, but their range is limited to only a mile or so; they can't erect a stone cathedral in a sandy desert. They can also repair a ruined structure or use the material of a ruined structure to build something new. The hands cannot make attacks or deal damage, and they are impervious to damage.
  You can use this ritual to build a stronghold whose constructed space does not exceed 300 squares. That space can be divided and arranged any way you please but must be contiguous.

This ritual aligns someone already invested with divine power with the deity or faith for which the ritual was created. It could be a deity that a person strayed from and wishes to return to, or it might be a different faith altogether. It cannot be performed by the character who is being reordained, but that character can assist. In most cases, the candidate for reordination is expected to complete a quest to prove his or her commitment to the new faith before the ritual is used.
    Upon completion of the ritual, its subject becomes associated with the appropriate deity, allowing him or her to select feats, powers, or any other class options requiring that tie. That person's previous association is dissolved, along with access to any related feats, powers, or other class options.
    If the ritual's subject is converting to a new deity, a single channel divinity feat associated with his or her former deity can be immediately exchanged for an appropriate one. For example, if a character previously worshiped Avandra and had the Avandra's Rescue feat, the character immediately loses the ability to use that feat but can automatically replace it with Raven Queen's Blessing, if the Raven Queen is the character's new patron deity.
    In addition, once the ritual is complete, the reordained character becomes vaguely aware of the existence and number of any agents (for example, angels, avengers, or other clerics) who have been charged with destroying him or her for crimes of heresy or apostasy. This awareness sharpens when such beings come within 1 mile of the character, but it does not identify or locate them. The awareness lasts for 7 days.

You lure a spirit into an effigy of your construction, creating a scarecrow that guards a permanent designated area of 12 squares by 12 squares against trespassers. The scarecrow also grants its creator brief visions through its eyes until the scarecrow is destroyed or until its creator dismisses it. This protected area surrounds the scarecrow's mount and is established as the scarecrow's "haunting grounds."
	Before you cast this ritual, you gather the specific components for the type of scarecrow you wish to create and place them upon a scarecrow mount. This mount can be a high pole or stake, a tree, a fencepost, a wooden frame, or a similar structure from which the scarecrow can survey the area it guards. This mount is the scarecrow's permanent post. It can leave its mount at will and it can patrol its haunting grounds, but it cannot willingly venture beyond them unless a combat encounter causes it to cross the perimeter (but see below). At the end of such an encounter, the scarecrow returns to its haunting grounds.
	If the scarecrow's creator commands it beyond its haunting grounds, moves its mount, or releases it from service, the scarecrow gains its freedom and is no longer bound to its mount or its haunting grounds. It has complete free will and can do as it wishes. Some creators never bind their scarecrows to haunting grounds. Instead, they offer their free-willed creations friendship and the choice to ally with their creators as companion characters. Free-willed scarecrows created by good creatures often choose to serve their creators this way.
	To complete the Create Scarecrow ritual, make a DC 25 Arcana check.
	Success: You successfully create the scarecrow of your choice of the ritual caster's level or lower. Demon  scarecrows can be created with this ritual only after completing a successful performance of the summon demon ritual.
	Failure: No spirit is compelled to inhabit the effigy. Instead, minor spirit vestiges settle on the materials, allowing you to create 6 scarecrow shamblers to patrol the same haunting grounds.
	No matter how many creatures assist in the ritual, the creature that makes the Arcana check is considered the scarecrow's creator.
	A scarecrow created with this ritual gains the following encounter power.

Triggered Actions
Master's Sight * Encounter
Trigger: The scarecrow hits an enemy with a melee attack.
Effect (Free Action): The scarecrow's creator can see through the scarecrow's eyes until the start of the scarecrow's next turn.&lt;/table&gt;

The potent gas interferes with the thought processes of a creature so it acts in an inappropriate fashion. For intelligent creatures, this means laughter. When you cool the gas, it becomes liquid so you can transfer it into a glass bead for easy delivery.

When you master this ritual, you choose a single type of aberrant creature, such as chaos beast or mind flayer. This choice remains fixed throughout your adventuring career. If you are able to create ritual scrolls, any scrolls you create also reflect this choice. This ritual can only be mastered once.
	For the ritual's duration, you are able to determine the presence or absence of creatures of the chosen type within 10 miles, but with no specific direction or distance information. If there are any within range, you can connect to the mind of a random creature of that type and try to gain information from it. The strain of making this connection (and of concealing it from the aberrant creature) causes you to lose one healing surge.
	Your Dungeoneering check result determines how many questions you can try to find the answers to. Once you have asked all the questions allowed by the ritual, the ritual ends.
	Your questions can be as specific or as general as you wish, but the answers you receive back are cryptic and rarely longer than a phrase, a short sentence, or a single image. In particular, aberrant creatures often have different conceptions of time, so questions regarding future events or plans are more likely to result in answers that are incomprehensible. The answers are also limited to what the individual creature knows, and its information could be incorrect if it has been misled by others.

&lt;table&gt;Dungeoneering Check Result	Number of Questions
9 or lower	One
10-19	Two
20-29	Three
30-39	Four
40 or higher	Five&lt;/table&gt;

If a particular creature does not know the information you seek, you can try to find another individual who does know it. If there is another such creature, you lose an additional healing surge, and you may re-ask any questions you wish answers for.
	Members of the Morphic Web can master and perform this ritual even if they cannot normally master rituals. They also do not lose a healing surge when making the first connection to an aberrant creature.

    <specific name="Full Text"> Blowgun
Superior two-handed ranged weapon
Cost: 5 gp
Damage: 1d4
Proficient: +3
Range: 5/10
Weight: 2 lb.

This long, tubular weapon is used by blowing on one end. It can launch darts and other agents.

Properties: 
Load Minor (Ranged weapons that loose projectiles, including bows, crossbows, and slings, take some time to load. When a weapon shows "load free" on the weapon table, that means you draw and load ammunition as a free action, effectively part of the action used to attack with the weapon. Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is "load minor," which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon. If a power allows you to hit multiple targets, the additional load time is accounted for in the power.).
Small (This property describes a two-handed or a versatile weapon that a Small character can use in the same way a Medium character can. A halfling can use a shortbow, for example, even though halflings can't normally use two-handed weapons.).

Description: A garment of this sort, made from the substance of a rainy Feywild afternoon, is created through the performance of a minor ritual. The garment looks and feels like a normal wool cloak, except that it keeps its wearer completely dry in the rain. When the cloak is spread out on the ground, it becomes a puddle of pure rainwater. You can turn the pool back into a cloak again by grabbing the water (a minor action), or water can be taken from the pool using a cup or a similar vessel. Doing so gradually uses up the cloak's material, making it shorter every time it reverts to a garment, until nothing is left of it after 2 gallons of its water are consumed. </specific>

A bundle of wolfsbane is usually enough to keep at bay a lycanthrope that lacks serious resolve; lycanthropes find its smell sickening, and though it cannot truly harm them, most go out of their way to avoid it.
	As a poison, wolfsbane has the same effect as ground thassil root (Dungeon Master's Guide, page 51). Lycanthropes experience a feeling of discomfort when within 30 feet of a bundle of wolfsbane, and any lycanthrope with a Fortitude of 17 or lower cannot willingly enter a square adjacent to a bundle of wolfsbane. </specific>

You ward an area up to 10 squares by 10 squares, and designate a spoken password that allows a creature to enter the warded area without triggering an alarm. This alarm can send a mental signal to you or make an audible ringing sound.
	If a Tiny or larger creature enters the warded area without speaking the password, the alarm you set triggers, and the ritual is discharged. However, an insubstantial creature or any creature that succeeds on a Stealth check (DC 10 + your Arcana check modifier) does not trigger the alarm.
	The result of triggering the alarm depends on the type of alarm. When an audible alarm triggers, all creatures in the warded area that are capable of hearing can hear the ringing. If they are sleeping, the noise awakens them. When a mental alarm triggers, a mental ping alerts you of the intrusion and awakens you from sleep. In either case, the alarm informs you where the warded area was breached.
	Focus: While holding a tiny bell (5 gp), you use a fine silver wire (5 gp) to scribe runes on the warded area's perimeter.

You create up to four floating orbs of light, or one light of vaguely humanoid shape. These lights can be of any color. Each orb sheds bright light in a 2-square radius; a humanoid-shaped light sheds dim light in a 2-square radius.
	Each light has a fly speed of 10. Whenever you use a move action to move, you can move all the lights as part of that action. You can also use a minor action to move all your lights up to their speed. You must have line of effect to a light to move it. Any light goes out if it is more than 20 squares from you at the end of your turn.

You cause the pockets of a garment (the focus) to hold far more than they normally can. When the ritual is performed, up to five pockets or pouches sewn into the focus can each hold up to 50 pounds in weight or 5 cubic feet in volume. Items in the affected pockets do not change the focus garment's form or weight. The garment's wearer can draw an item from an affected pocket as a minor action. When the ritual ends, items in the affected pockets appear in a pile at the garment-wearer's feet.
	Focus: A fine cloth garment (50 gp).

You scribe magical runes on an object such as a book, a scroll, a map, or a similar item that weighs no more than 10 pounds. These runes look like normal writing but function as a trap (see Explosive Runes trap.) As you inscribe them, you can create a password that allows a creature to read the runes without triggering the trap. If the trap is triggered or disabled, the ritual is discharged.

You inscribe a glyph that works as a dangerous trap (see Glyph of Warding trap) on a flat surface such as a wall, chest lid, table, or door. As you create the trap, you set the glyph's damage type, trigger, password and/or exceptions. The trigger you set must require the trap's target to enter the glyph's square, pass within range of the glyph's attack, or open or handle a warded object without speaking the password or meeting an exception. Acceptable exceptions include creature origin, creature type, physical characteristics, and named individuals. The glyph becomes nearly invisible once it is completed.

You can ask one question regarding a particular action, framing the question so that the answer tells you whether the chosen action will benefit or harm you or an ally. This ritual can see only about half an hour into the future, and it deals only with the immediate effects of taking a specific action. The ritual cannot deduce long-term consequences or predict the outcome of long-term actions.
	Once you ask the question, the DM secretly rolls an Arcana check or Religion check (whichever provides the higher modifier) for you against a moderate DC. Your allies cannot aid you in making this check. If you try again to predict the outcome of the same action, the ritual supplies the same check result. 
	Successful Check: The DM tells you that the intended action should bring one of these results.
	Weal—a good result, such as when the reward outweighs the risk.
	Woe—a bad result, such as when the risk outweighs the reward.
	Weal and Woe—both good and bad, such as when the reward is equal to the risk.
	Nothing—neither a good nor a bad result.
	Failed Check: As per “nothing” above. You can't tell if this “nothing” is due to a successful check or a failed check.
	Focus: You drop a set of marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens (worth 50 gp) to read the answer to your query in their arrangement.

Choose a specific outdoor location that you have previously visited and that is within 1 mile of your current position. The location must be fixed in place, and it must be at the same place as when you last visited. You place a scrying sensor in a square up to 10 squares above that location. Gazing into your focus (a pool of water), you can see and hear from that square as if you occupied it.
	The sensor remains for 2 rounds. You can extend the duration by another 2 rounds by spending a healing surge.
	A scrying sensor appears as a shimmer in the air. Creatures can spot the sensor by succeeding on a Perception check (DC 10 + your level).
	Some warding rituals can block scrying sensors. If the location is so warded, or the location is otherwise unviable as a scrying target, then you learn this fact as soon as you start the ritual. You can then stop the ritual before you expend any components.

After placing a piece of parchment over the surface to be copied, rub the  charcoal against it while applying gentle pressure. With a standard action, you can make a rubbing covering 1 square foot. One kit contains enough material for ten such rubbings.

    <specific name="Full Text"> Hurler-Snatcher
Category: Gear
Price: 10 gp 
Weight: 4 lb
Description: With some foraged twine, a supple reed, simple pulleys, and a soft cloth bindle, a kobold can piece together a crude device for getting around obstacles. These hurler-snatchers, as kobolds call them, have long been used to fling objects across gaps safely and retrieve small items lost down narrow chasms.
	Using a hurler-snatcher (4 lb., 10 gp) requires a move action. When you do so, you either transfer one item you have that weighs 5 pounds or less to an unoccupied space or a willing character within 5 squares of you, or you take one similar item that the character or the space has and transfer it to yourself. If you intend to transfer the item to a character, he or she has to have a free hand and must use a free action to catch it. Otherwise, the item lands in that character's space.
	The 5-pound limit on a  hurler-snatcher is enough to carry most simple objects. If items are bundled together in a backpack or a sack, they're usually too heavy to flick around. Some items are too unwieldy to be transferred in this way; your DM ultimately makes the call.
	The hurler-snatcher is constructed to protect what it carries, even glassware, as long as the intended receiver can catch it. Objects break in transit only in a very small number of cases. Kobolds offer no warranties on items sent by way of a hurler-snatcher. </specific>

31-34	A gargoyle (level 9) appears.
35+	A gargoyle harrier (level 11), a gargoyle rock hurler (level 11), or an ice gargoyle (level 12) appears.&lt;/table&gt;

The summoned gargoyle understands anything you command, but it cannot speak any new languages.

Once summoned, the gargoyle guards one object or an area until it is killed. The gargoyle attacks any creature that appeoaches the object or enters the area, though it allows for any exceptions you make. Runic gargoyles protect you, rather than an object or a location.

	You create a doorway to another time, linking the present with the past or the future. By stepping through the portal, you move to another point on the time line.
	The ritual works only if you perform it within a permanent teleportation circle. The portal opens within the circle.
	During the ritual's performance, make a History check. The result determines how far into the past or future you can travel.
	
&lt;table&gt;History Check Result	Distance in Time
19 or lower	Up to 1 year
20–29	Up to 10 years
30–39	Up to 100 years
40 or higher	Any point&lt;/table&gt;

At the completion of this ritual, make an Arcana check. The result determines how long the portal remains open.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Portal Duration
19 or lower	1 round
20–39	3 rounds
40 or higher	5 rounds&lt;/table&gt;

This ritual otherwise works the same as Linked Portal in regard to how the portal functions, how it appears, and what happens when creatures interact with it.

	When you finish performing the ritual, the spirit of yourself from an earlier time you choose appears before you. It is the person you were at that time, and it approaches you with that perspective. You can converse with the spirit for the duration of the ritual. If you remember the right time in your own past to call on the spirit, you can question yourself when important knowledge is still fresh in your mind.
	
	The Speak to the Youth Within ritual seemingly died with Omarosa, since she kept it a closely guarded secret. Possessing the torc of the younger self does not impart knowledge of the ritual. Each time a character uses the torc's utility power, he or she should attempt a DC 34 Arcana check. If successful, the character realizes that the torc has another function but receives no indication of what that function is.
	A character can uncover the lost ritual through research into the torc's history. Hired sages can perform the research, or characters can tackle it themselves. Rituals such as Consult Mystic Sages, Consult Oracle, and Loremaster's Bargain are another option. Any route can culminate in a quest to locate Omarosa's tomb and question her using the Speak with Dead ritual.

You might discover that you know secrets you didn't know before, or that you remember events that didn't happen.

This revolting goo is an alchemical concentration of the aberrant poisons in aboleths' mucus, which must be harvested from the foul pools in which the creatures dwell. Splashing aboleth slime over a living creature brings it spasms of pain as its form twists uncontrollably. The process of collecting the disgusting stuff is exceedingly hazardous, making this formula both hard to find and very expensive.
