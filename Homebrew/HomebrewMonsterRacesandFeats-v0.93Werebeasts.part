A Werebeast, commonly referred to as "lycanthropes", is a bestial shapeshifters that preys on other living creatures. It often assumes animal form in the wild, hunting in packs with similar animals or others of its kind. 
When infiltrating civilized humanoid settlements, it assumes a benign humanoid form, blending in with the local populace. Werebeasts gather in clannish communities hidden in remote places, or they live secretly among other races.
Although they hunt when they please, Werebeasts are most active on nights of the full moon. A Werebeast superficially resembles a human or other humanoid creature. It stands erect but has the head of a ravenous animal, such as a rat or wolf.
A Werebeast can assume the form of a specific humanoid, usually a human with subtle physical traits that betray the creature's true heritage such as long hair, long fingernails, or pointed teeth, for instance. 
Normally, a werebeast assumes humanoid form only when it needs to disguise itself as something nonthreatening.

Brutish and feral, werewolves dwell alone or in small wilderness clans. 
They frequently run with wolf packs, especially when the moon is full. They sometimes join bandit gangs or become mercenaries. Werewolves prefer to stick to the borderlands but occasionally work inside cities. Anyone who employs a werewolf must be prepared to satisfy the creature's thirst for blood.
