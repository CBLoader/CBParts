You can create a powerful bond between yourself and a single horse. Creating the bond takes one week. Once the bond is created, you can communicate with the bonded horse empathically. This allows you to know whenever your horse is afraid, hungry, or in pain, out to a range of about 1 mile. In addition, when you are with your horse, you can look in its eyes and get a sense of what it has seen in the past 12 hours. (This sense is not a vivid picture, but a rough understanding of the animal's perspective.) You can only have one bond of this type at a time.
If you are ever permanently separated from your bonded horse, or if the bonded horse dies, the bond is broken and you take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for one week due to the extreme trauma. This penalty applies even if the horse is ultimately raised from the dead. After this mourning period, you may bond with a new horse or reset the previously existing bond.
