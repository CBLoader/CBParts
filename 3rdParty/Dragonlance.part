      <Prereqs> ~DARKDWARF </Prereqs>
      <Flavor> From the lightless depths of the dwarven kingdoms, the dark dwarves of Ansalon plot and scheme against the clans of their light-loving brothers and against each other. </Flavor>

      <specific name="Physical Qualities"> The Daergar clan of Dark Dwarves are similar to their light-loving cousins in appearance. They range from 4' to 4'6" in height and are often nearly as wide as they are tall. Hair color ranges from light brown to black; their eyes cover the same spectrum of color. The Theiwar clan, through centures of inbreeding and isolation, have developed two interesting physical traits. First, they are extremely fair, with many true albinos among their number. Second, while they are roughly the same height as other dwarves, they tend to be somewhat skinny and are more wiry than their bretheren. A Zhakar clan Dark Dwarf begins his life looking as any other dwarf. However, as his life progress, the mold plague carried by his clan changes his appearance to something considered grotesque by other dwarves. By middle age, all of the Zhakar's hair will have fallen out, and his eyes will have become a milky-white. His skin will be discolored and splotchy, with odd patches of skin that molt continuously. Not enough time has passed since Severus Stonehand cured some of the Zhakar of their plague to know what impact this will have on the the clan and their appearance. </specific>
      <specific name="Playing"> Dark dwarves are naturally suspicious of others. They tend to keep to themselves and only surrender information when they feel it is necessary; trust is almost an alien concept. Dark dwarves trust only the backstabbing nature they see in every race. They usually only interact with other races if they feel they can gain something in the exchange. If a dark dwarf saves a companion in a fight, it just means the dwarf has other uses for that person. </specific>

      <Prereqs> ~KAGONESTIELF </Prereqs>
      <Flavor> Truly Children of the Wood, the Kagonesti, of all the different varieties of elves, are the most at home in the deep wilderness. Their lifestyle has changed little in four thousand years of elven civilization. </Flavor>
      <specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>
      <specific name="Speed"> 7 squares </specific>
      <specific name="Characteristics"> Agile, intuitive, joyful, perceptive, quick, quiet, suspicious, wild </specific>
      <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Kagonesti look the least like the stereotypical elf. They tend to be shorter in stature but more muscular than other elves. Their skin is usually a rich brown-darker than their more civilized cousins-ranging from the hue of honeystained oak to the deep bronze of weathered mahogany. Their hair is often darker than other elves' as well, with shades from the silky red-black of ironwood to the sandy tan of pine. Some Kagonesti have been known to have silvery white hair, starkly contrasting with their darker complexion. Many women wear their hair in a long single braid, a fashion popularized by Kerianseray. Their eyes are almost always the brown of hazel nuts. Their faces tend to be more weathered than other elves, a consequence of spending so many years in the elements. Despite this, even the most rugged and weather-beaten Kagonesti face appears the very picture of perfection compared to most humans. </specific>
      <specific name="Playing"> When creating an elf adventurer, here are a few points to consider.
	Protect all that is good and beautiful. The natural progression of the universe seems intent on destroying the fleeting grace of beauty, love, and peace. Thus, you must fight to ensure that these things survive. An elf might remain unmoved by the plight of a human city facing an orc invasion, even as an idyllic village of farmers in the horde's path spurs him to action. Elves appreciate beauty because their history has forced them to watch it gradually fade from the world. From the first days of the bitter fey war, through the rise and fall of a succession of worldly empires, the elves know all too well that anything worth enjoying or loving is worth fighting for.
	Life is measured in years, not days. You are acutely aware of the unfurling of years and the grand tapestry of history. Elves plan for the long term, and you are no different. "Enjoy the day; prepare for the year," is a common elf saying that expresses this attitude. You might spend your days in song and drink easily enough, but all the while in the back of your mind, you watch a web of events unfold around you. You understand that an action now leads to a reaction-a change in the world-that might not become evident for years. When you adventure, you keep one eye on the future and your role in the grand scheme of events.
	The strongest sword is guided with wisdom, not might. The best battles are those that are short, decisive, and as bloodless as possible. The elves are too few in number to wage wars of attrition, and they view risky tactics and frontal assaults as foolish at best. As an elf, you employ the most direct methods to defeat your enemy. Why waste time battling goblin patrols when the entire tribe will scatter with the death of its conquest-minded king? Keep the long-term view in mind, and settle all problems with quick, decisive resolution.
	Tales and songs. The elves preserve their history through songs and tales told in the oral tradition. As a young elf, you would have heard and memorized these stories of great elf heroes, their legendary deeds, and the struggles of your people. You might draw on the nature, events, or themes of such stories for inspiration, or to express your elven point of view to your allies. </specific>

Their skin is the color of white pine, with some even fairer still. Their hair ranges from the light brown of maple to aspenbark white, and it's often worn in long, elaborate braids and arrangements. A few Silvanesti are born with hair the charcoal black of fire-tested firs. </specific>

      <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Gnomes average a height of 3 feet and weigh between 45 and 50 pounds. They tend to have walnut-colored skin that darkens with exposure to the sun. Their hair is thin and naturally curly. Young gnomes have hair of silver, red, or light brown, which often turns entirely white by adulthood, although streaks of their original hair color may exist into old age. Gnomish hair is nearly always messy or hastily tied up to get it out of the way. Throughout the ages, it has been determined that hair cutting inventions are best left tested on mannequins or livestock; consequently, gnomes rarely cut their hair. However, it grows rather slowly, and male gnomes tend to only ever grow short curly beards. </specific>
      <specific name="Playing"> Tinker gnome life involves all sorts of gadgets and inventions. Tinker gnomes are the most technologically advanced civilization on the continent of Ansalon. They have steam-powered ships and trains, clockwork timepieces and ore-refining plants for highgrade steel. Gnomish society is comprised of a number of organizations known as guilds. Each guild is centered around a particular generalized area of interest and contributes to the functioning of the society. Playing a tinker gnome offers the player a chance to play a character who is situated outside the norm for most adventuring parties. Tinker gnome characters always seem a bit off kilter. Their assumptions are often misguided, and their methodology in dealing with different situations is often flawed. The challenge for a person playing a tinker gnome character is to find a way to make the gnome seem intelligent, yet often wrong. </specific>

      <Prereqs> ~MADGNOME </Prereqs>
      <Flavor> In every society, there are individuals who operate outside of the accepted norm. This is no different for the gnomish race. In gnomish society, these individuals are known as mad gnomes. They are gnomes who repeatedly break or no longer conform to the acceptable customs of society. </Flavor>

      <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Gnomes average a height of 3 feet and weigh between 45 and 50 pounds. They tend to have walnut-colored skin that darkens with exposure to the sun. Their hair is thin and naturally curly. Young gnomes have hair of silver, red, or light brown, which often turns entirely white by adulthood, although streaks of their original hair color may exist into old age. Gnomish hair is nearly always messy or hastily tied up to get it out of the way. Throughout the ages, it has been determined that hair cutting inventions are best left tested on mannequins or livestock; consequently, gnomes rarely cut their hair. However, it grows rather slowly, and male gnomes tend to only ever grow short curly beards. </specific>
      <specific name="Playing"> There are a number of different ways a gnome might become branded a mad gnome. The gnome may continually break the laws of their guild, sabotage another gnome's work, persistently display thought processes that do not resonate with gnomish culture (such as believing in Cause and Effect), always creating devices that work and are considered complete, or even displaying no inclination for tinkering or science. The fun of playing a mad gnome character lies in the flexibility of playing a gnome outside of the tinker gnome stereotype. The personality traits of gnomish condescension and uncaring can be put aside when you're a mad gnome. In addition, it allows you the challenge of roleplaying a character that has been ostracized from their own society, while at the same time, having to deal with the discrimination other races have toward gnomes in general.</specific>

Common abbreviated male names include Cogg, Deddalo, Gear, Gnerd, Innova, and Snork; Bethi, Gauge, Gnorra, Nano, Pidge, Pestle, and Sulfie are common female names. </specific>

      <specific name="Playing"> The wild gnomes have adapted rapidly to a life of rustic inventiveness and communal living. These gnomes have become highly skilled, if erratic and unpredictable, biological tinkers, producing some of the most bizarre and unexpected plants and creatures on Ansalon. Wild gnomes are obsessed with life and living things. Despite their name, they are not barbaric, merely unconcerned with civilization. Wild gnomes are a distinct change of pace from the standard tinker gnome, yet have just as much of the gnomish tendency to want to experiment and research as their cousins. Choose a wild gnome if you want a new approach to a wilderness-oriented class, such as druid or ranger, or if you like gnomes but not their inventions and gadgets. </specific>

Some half-goblins, such as those with bugbear ancestry, are hairy and bulky around the shoulders; those with goblin ancestry are smaller.

They inherit all the ambition and drive of their human parent and the ferocity and mob mentality of their goblin parent. If left to reach adulthood, the result is a zealous outcast who seeks to right all of the wrongs inflicted on his ancestors.

The hoopak is probably the most well known of the kender weapons. It is typically a 3-foot staff made of hard yet supple wood that is forked at one end and has a metal tip at the other. The metal tip can be sharpened and the hoopak can be thrown like a shortspear. The hoopak can also be stuck into the ground so that missiles can be fired from the forked end like a slingshot. It can also be twirled over the head like a sling to launch sling bullets or stones, or it may be used as a traditional sling staff.

Properties:
Load Free (Ranged weapons that loose projectiles, including bows, crossbows, and slings, take some time to load. When a weapon shows "load free" on the ranged weapons table, that means you draw and load ammunition as a free action, effectively part of the action used to attack with the weapon. Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it).
Small (This property describes a two-handed or a versatile weapon that a Small character can use in the same way a Medium character can. A kender can use a hoopak, for example, even though kender can't normally use two-handed weapons).

Group:
Sling (Slings are leather straps used to hurl stones or metal pellets. They are projectile weapons).

Superior one-handed ranged weapon
Cost: 5 gp
Damage: 1d6
Proficient: +2
Range: 10/20
Weight: 1 lb.

Properties: 
Load Free (Ranged weapons that loose projectiles, including bows, crossbows, and slings, take some time to load. When a weapon shows "load free" on the ranged weapons table, that means you draw and load ammunition as a free action, effectively part of the action used to attack with the weapon. Any weapon that has the load property requires two hands to load, even if you can use only one hand to attack with it. (The sling, for example, is a one-handed weapon, but you need a free hand to load it.) The crossbow is "load minor," which means it requires a minor action to load a bolt into the weapon. If a power allows you to hit multiple targets, the additional load time is accounted for in the power).

Group: 
Sling (Slings are leather straps used to hurl stones or metal pellets. They are projectile weapons.). </specific>

      <specific name="Characteristics"> Brave, bold, curious, down-to-earth, friendly, good-natured, lucky, nimble, optimistic, resourceful, warm </specific>
      <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Kender typically stand no more than 3 to 4 feet tall, with the males usually being taller than the females. They weigh between 80 and 100 pounds. Adult kender are well muscled, despite being thin and light of build. Kender are sometimes mistaken for young humans, but closer inspection reveals the pointed ears, face wrinkles, and many pouches indicative of kender. Kender find their face wrinkles, also called crow's feet or laugh-lines, highly attractive. Kender hair color ranges from light blond to deep brown to black with a few sporting red-orange hues. Most kender wear their hair long. The most common hairstyle is the topknot. It's also common among kender nobility to braid their sideburns as a sign of their status. Kender typically favor bright colors and gaudy apparel that is at the same time rugged and rustic. Most kender add accents to their clothing and weapons by tagging them with ribbons, feathers, beads, or colorful scarves. All kender-made clothing, regardless of what it is, has pockets and lots of them. The staple of all kender outfits, however, is the many pouches. It is rare to see a kender with less than two pouches, though they usually have many more than that. </specific>
      <specific name="Playing"> Kender are born with the heart of an explorer and an intense curiosity that can not be denied. This leads them to explore every nook and cranny, check behind every door, and snoop in every pocket. Over time, a kender can learn to understand the need for caution in some situations, such as when their friends may be hurt as a direct result of their actions. Kender are attracted to magic and gadgets like dwarves to ale. Kender are in awe of anything magical: items, spells, and creatures pique a kender's interest, and they can often be found wandering around places rumored to be magical.
The best way to play a kender character is to rein in some of the more overbearing kender personality traits. Many DMs have banned kender characters from their games, because most players feel in order to successfully play a kender they must be foolish and disruptive to the game. Be friendly without talking endlessly, be fearless but not foolhardy, be curious but smart. If you are a true kender, don't always attempt to steal valuable items. Keep in mind that to a kender a shiny river stone is just as enticing as a diamond.</specific>

      <specific name="Names"> Tradition dictates kender parents select a name for their child around the moment of birth. The child's first name can be based off any combination of factors. The most common method is to name the child after an existing relative; Kipper, Kronin, Tavin, Rufus, or Meridon are a few. Occasionally, parents name the kender after an event in a recent adventure, such as Triplever, Mudskipper, or Thistleprick, or after common kender objects like Lockpick, Toolkit, and Topknot. There are countless other variations of kender first names. Each kender takes their parent's last name. There are specific family names, which have survived the ages; Metwinger, Thistleknott, Thistleswitch, and Burrfoot are some examples, but it is common practice for kender to adopt a more descriptive name later on in life after their adventures, such as Springheel, Lightfingers, Pakslinger, or Lampwick. Usually during their wanderlust, they leave home to make a name for themselves, literally. Some also decide that they want to be like famous kender who came before them, and take on that kender's name. This happened in the decades following the War of the Lance when a large number of kender took the name Tasslehoff Burrfoot. </specific>

      <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Kender typically stand no more than 3 to 4 feet tall, with the males usually being taller than the females. They weigh between 80 and 100 pounds. Adult kender are well muscled, despite being thin and light of build. Kender are sometimes mistaken for young humans, but closer inspection reveals the pointed ears, face wrinkles, and many pouches indicative of kender. Kender find their face wrinkles, also called crow's feet or laugh-lines, highly attractive. Kender hair color ranges from light blond to deep brown to black with a few sporting red-orange hues. Most kender wear their hair long. The most common hairstyle is the topknot. It's also common among kender nobility to braid their sideburns as a sign of their status. Kender typically favor bright colors and gaudy apparel that is at the same time rugged and rustic. Most kender add accents to their clothing and weapons by tagging them with ribbons, feathers, beads, or colorful scarves. All kender-made clothing, regardless of what it is, has pockets and lots of them. The staple of all kender outfits, however, is the many pouches. It is rare to see a kender with less than two pouches, though they usually have many more than that. </specific>
      <specific name="Playing"> After the Chaos War, Malystryx the great red dragon, began to use her magic to transform the lands into a habitat more suitable for her. Eventually, every living thing on the Goodlund Peninsula was affected by her magic. The kender living there could feel it, and it changed them. It saddened them to see the lands that they called home dying, knowing there was nothing they could do to stop it. They were powerless to prevent this perversion. Within a year of Malystryx's arrival, she had made her way to Kendermore. Once there, she slaughtered thousands of kender. The destruction was so horrible and on such a grand scale that any living kender who was tainted by the Overlord's magic or witnessed the horrors of the attack learned the one thing kender had blissfully been immune to since their creation: fear. Some afflicted kender are depressed, timid and jump at every encounter. Others are similar to true kender, those whose parents experienced the Kender Flight, but they always seem to shy away from anything too dangerous. Afflicted kender tend to over analyze situations. They don't like surprises and do their best to discover them before they happen or avoid them completely. If this means checking every chest, opening every door, and rifling through people's pouches when necessary, so be it. Afflicted kender are motivated by a need to feel safe and secure at all times. This need does not make them shutins, but instead, they feel motivated to do what they can to ensure their own safety and that of their friends and companions.</specific>

He is the second most-worshipped god by the minotaurs, who also call him "Emperor". He is closest to Reorx and Shinare among the Gods of Neutrality, and is in opposition with Sargonnas, his opposite in war, who has a more violent approach to battle. He is also against Hiddukel because of his lies and deceit. His celestial symbol is the constellation Bison's Head.

The cleric Goldmoon was given the Blue Crystal Staff to restore the faith of the Gods to the world. The teachings of Mishakal, taken up by Goldmoon, led to the discovery of mysticism when magic was lost after the Chaos War. She is loved by all the Gods of Good, and the Gods of Neutrality all hold her in regard. She is in opposition to every God of Evil for the same reasons she is beloved by the Gods of Good. Every God of Evil harms life in some way, and for that reason Mishakal opposes them all. Her celestial symbol is the constellation Infinity.

He is the leader of the Gods of Light until the War of Souls. He furthers the High God's plan among those who follow the ideals of compassion and peace. He leads the other Gods of Good through his example. Paladine responds to the demands of the Kingpriest, who arrogantly demands power from the Gods, by casting the fiery mountain upon the world, causing the Cataclysm. Paladine takes the form of the absent-minded wizard Fizban the Fabulous to aid the Heroes of the Lance. From these strifes, he may be the first kender "god" as the immortal figure of Fizban. Such is evident is "Uncle Tas'" desire to have Fizban at such a state, this is only speculation, however. He sacrifices his godhood after the War of Souls to balance Takhisis's death. He is a patriarch of sorts to the Gods of Light. He is advised by Majere and is the partner of Mishakal. Kiri-Jolith and Habbakuk are also close to him. He honors Solinari by taking the form of a white robed wizard during the War of the Lance. He respects the Gods of Neutrality with no special friends among them, and opposes all Gods of Evil. His celestial symbol is the constellation Platinum Dragon.

Solinari, also known as the Mighty Hand, the Ivory Disk, and God's Eye, represents the godly power of magic used for good. He patrons wizards who use their magic with the ideals of compassion, protection, and foresight. As one of the creators of the Laws of High Sorcery he upholds them vigorously.

Solinari guides the souls of good wizards to the Beyond. At one point he dwells in the Dome of Creation but chooses to represent himself in the white moon of Krynn in order to watch over and protect magic. He promotes using magic for the good of all the world. He is friendly with Majere, Habbakuk, Branchala, and Mishakal. He is saddened at Paladine's downfall and offered him his protection, which Paladine, called Valthonis, refused.

Chislev is wracked with pain and suffering during times of war, and works in the current world to heal the wounds done to it. She is the partner of Zivilyn, and maintains friendship with Sirrion. She conflicts with Shinare and Reorx. Gilean grants Chislev knowledge but he is at times overly intelligent for her.

Gilean, also known as the Book, the Sage, and the Gray Voyager, represents the godly force of knowledge. He supports the growth of the soul through attaining knowledge and experience. He is the holder of the Tobril, which contains the divine plan of the High God for the world. He is the patron of sages, librarians, and scholars. He is the leader of the Gods of Balance. He supports free will and individual choice for all individuals of Krynn. He is one of the first gods to be called out of the Beyond and is on equal power with Takhisis and Paladine. A legend of him states that the High God commanded Gilean to ensure his own existence by raising the soul of a mortal scholar who would one day become him, in an ontological paradox of sorts. That scholar is most likely Astinus, who watches over the Great Library of Palanthas and scribes all history as it happens until the Chaos War. Gilean is a mediator between the Gods of Good and Evil, siding against the faction that threatens the Balance. All of the Gods of Neutrality look to him for help and advice, and the Gods of Light often do the same in hopes he will side with them. The Gods of Evil manipulate situations to present Gilean with a case where he can only side with them, such as in the Chaos War where Takhisis forces Gilean to side with her Dark Knights, as they are the only chance that mortals can stand against Chaos. His celestial symbol is the constellation Book of Souls.

Lunitari, also known as the Veiled Maiden, Maid of Illusion, and Night Candle, represents the power of magic used for neutrality. She supports wizards who use magic in the name of balance, freedom, and curiosity. She seeks to preserve the balance of good and evil in magic. She is once the power divine force of mystery, but she removes herself from the Hidden Vale and joins her cousins Solinari and Nuitari in order to give magic her closer attention. Her focus instead became the mystery of magic. She is said to come fully born from the thoughts of her father Gilean. She resides in and represents herself through the red moon of Krynn. She tells to her faithful the secrets and discoveries of magic. She is close to Reorx, who sometimes helps her in forging magical artifacts. She, along with Reorx, conspires to trap Chaos in the Graygem, which has led the other Gods of Neutrality to distrust her. She rarely interacts with the Gods of Good and Evil, except for her cousins Solinari and Nuitari, whom she is especially close to, almost always being with them at the meetings of the gods. Her celestial symbol is the red moon, Lunitari.

Reorx, also known as the Forge, the World Smith, and Tamer of Chaos, represents the godly force of creation. He desires for souls to grow through crafting and gaining skill. He is the patron of dwarves and gnomes, but also of all craftsmen. He is also followed by gamblers and rogues because they rely on their own talents to change the course of an event. He respects and encourages the power of mortals to shape, build, and produce. Reorx often takes the mortal form of a handsomely dressed dwarf named Dougan Redhammer. Reorx, at the behest of the High God, created the world of Krynn from the raw energies of Chaos. He unknowingly encases Chaos into the Graygem when he sought a bit of the essence of the higher deity to anchor the balance in the world, which later has dire repercussions on the world, releasing an aspect of hatred and destruction upon Ansalon, causing the Chaos War. He is a much loved deity; he works with Shinare and Gilean, and is respected by Sargonnas and Kiri-Jolith for his power of smithing mighty weapons. Zeboim is known to go to Reorx to better understand the workings of ships and the like, so that she can better destroy them. The dwarves hold that Reorx created them as his chosen; however, Reorx creates the gnomes instead when a chosen group of men fall from his grace. The dwarves and the kender are created when the energies of Chaos morph a group of gnomes into the two races. His celestial symbol is the red star Reorx.

Shinare, also known as Winged Victory, the Silver Mistress, and Walking Liberty, represents the godly force of interaction. Those who follow Shinare grow by communicating with other people. She oversees all oaths, negotiations, and partnerships. She promotes the advancement of the world through enterprise. She patrons merchants, without regard to motivation so long as business is done fairly. With that principle in mind, she does not condemn slavery or mercenary activity. Things like theft and cheating, however, she opposes as they impair the principles of interaction. She secretly influenced the development of steel as the principle currency of Ansalon, and has recently become a major influence in the nation of Solamnia. Shinare is partnered with Sirrion, whom she sometimes clashes with because of his chaotic tendencies. She works with Reorx as well, but has only basic, polite relationships with the other Gods of Neutrality. She is closest to Kiri-Jolith and Majere among the Gods of Light because of her belief in honesty and truth, and directly opposes Hiddukel among the Gods of Evil because of his lies and cheating. Her celestial symbol is the planet Shinare.

Sirrion, also known as the Flowing Flame, the Alchemist, and the Firemaster, represents the godly force of transformation. He promotes the soul to give in to passion and creativity to grow and change. He represents fire, because it is the element that brings change and growth, and it represents the creativity of artists and alchemists. Sirrion is chaotic, but does not condone random destruction; instead, change should produce something new. He is the patron of art and alchemy. Legend holds that he created his partner Shinare from grand metals, and that he gave fire to Reorx for the creation of the world. In truth, his responsibility was equal to the other gods. He is the companion of Shinare, although being her complete opposite; however, his passion with her progressive spirit can create much in the world. Sirrion works with Reorx and Chislev, but does not often work with Zivilyn or Gilean. Sirrion is close to Branchala and Habbakuk among the Gods of Light, and opposes Sargonnas among the Gods of Evil, for Sargonnas directs flame into the spirit of wrath and revenge. His celestial symbol is the planet Sirrion.

Zivilyn, despite his extensive knowledge of all times and places of Krynn, cannot foresee Takhisis stealing the world away during the War of Souls. Zivilyn is respected by all Gods, and never chooses sides in a fight or disagreement. He is closest to Gilean and is the partner of Chislev, and has much in common with Majere and Hiddukel because of their understandings of the power of wisdom and awareness, respectively. Zivilyn does not allow the forces of compassion or corruption to influence him. His celestial symbol is the planet Zivilyn.

Chemosh disdains life, feeling that it is wasted on the people of Krynn. He prefers to promise "immortality" by making souls into undead rather than letting them pass into the afterlife. Chemosh gains power as people surrender their free will to him. Chemosh sits in the Hall of Soul's Passing and watches the progression of souls into the afterlife, where he attempts to lure souls into becoming undead. Chemosh is the direct opposite of Mishakal as she promotes life and hope. He is the foe of all of the Gods of Good, and among the Gods of Neutrality is in opposition to Chislev, for disrupting the natural order of life, and Sirrion, for suppressing hope and creativity. He has few allies but sometimes works with Hiddukel and Morgion due to the nature of his schemes. His celestial symbol is the constellation Goat's Skull.

Hiddukel, also known as the Prince of Lies, the Betrayer, and the Broken Scales, represents the godly force of exploitation. He influences souls to use every encounter with another person to their advantage. He captures souls who are desiring or despairing to use the misfortune of others to their profit. He is ultimately selfish and cares for no one but himself, and passes that attitude on to his mortal followers. Hiddukel constantly attempts to make deals with the other gods, and his lies lead mortals to carry out evil in the world. He is impressed and surprised at the deception of Takhisis in stealing the world from the other Gods. He can call upon nearly all of the Gods of Evil for aid because of his dealing with them and his ability to divert their attention from him if they begin to suspect him. All of the Gods of Neutrality - especially Shinare, because of her promoting of fairness and honesty - oppose him. Reorx as well dislikes him because Hiddukel tricked him into forging the Graygem. Majere and Branchala among the Gods of Good are his enemies, as the powers of discipline and positive interaction respectively. His celestial symbol is the constellation Broken Scale.

Morgion, also known as the Black Wind, Master of the Bronze Tower, and the Rat King, represents the godly force of decay. He urges souls to break down their complexities to attain their most basic form. He believes mortals should leave Krynn with nothing but what they came in with. Morgion is the god of diseases and of the ultimate decay of all things, from individuals to nations. Morgion succeeds in the suffering of Krynn. Morgion opposes things like a healthy, wholesome life or a quick, painless death. He believes that the strong survive, and to survive one must suffer. Morgion remains isolated from the other gods and tries to infect the world with plague and horror. He seeks to make Krynn endure as much pain as possible. He opposes Mishakal, Majere, and Habbakuk especially among the Gods of Good, all of whom oppose him. Chislev opposes him for seeking to degrade life, and Sirrion is against him because of Morgion's constant gloom. Shinare and Reorx oppose his goals as well. He interacts little with the other Gods of Evil, brooding in the Bronze Tower at the edge of the Abyss. His celestial symbol is the constellation Diseased Hood.

Nuitari, also known as the Devouring Dark, Nightreaver, and Ungod, represents the power of magic used for evil. He patrons wizards who use magic for greed, revenge, hatred, and ambition. He uses the laws of High Sorcery, but only in an attempt to strengthen his own power. He was once representative of the godly force of ambition, but he leaves the Abyss and houses his essence in the black moon of Krynn. His focus now is the Black Robed wizards and watching them as they go through their lives. Nuitari is the son of Takhisis and Sargonnas. He houses his essence into the black moon when it becomes apparent to him that magic needs to be brought under control, to prevent it from falling into the hands of wild mages. Nuitari, for the most part, loathes his fellow Gods of Evil, and especially detests Takhisis for directing arcane power into the Gray Robed Knights of Takhisis. The only Gods Nuitari regularly interacts with are his cousins Solinari and Lunitari, whom he is especially close to. They are always seen together at meetings among the Gods and promotes alliegence to magic first over the forces of good and evil and law and chaos. His celestial symbol is the black moon, Nuitari.

Sargonnas, also known as the Red Condor, the Firebringer, and the Bull God, represents the godly force of wrath. He orders souls to seek revenge on anything that does them wrong or takes power from them. He is the master of vengeance, wars fought for passion, anger, volcanoes, birds of prey and broken promises. His followers are focused in the use of discipline and order for their pursuits. He is the favorite god of minotaurs, who claim him to be the supreme deity and name him Sargas. Sargonnas favors the minotaurs in turn. Sargonnas is the consort to Takhisis, despite having an uneasy partnership with her; he can ally with her or oppose her to further his own goals. With Takhisis gone and his followers flourishing, Sargonnas is a powerful god in the current time of Krynn. Sargonnas has no real allies. He conflicts with his child Nuitari, and Chemosh, Morgion, and Hiddukel are distrusted by him. He does, however, ally with Zeboim, because his minotaurs are a sea-faring people, and they often honor her. Kiri-Jolith and Paladine are his enemies among the Gods of Good, although each side has a grudging respect for the other. His celestial symbol is the constellation Condor. Sargonnas is known to appear in several forms: His most favored form is a minotaur with jet black or blood red fur, massive horns and blazing eyes, but he can also appear as a minotaur made of magma or a monstrous condor. Minotaurs claim that five is Sargonnas's favored number.

Takhisis, also known as the Queen of Darkness, the Many-Headed Dragon, The Dragon of Many Colors and None, The Temptress, and the Dark Warrior, represents the godly force of control. She brings souls under her will and encourages them to grow according to her plans for conquest. She orders souls to surrender to dominance and give way to those who are stronger. She likewise orders souls to dominate others. She is the highest power among the Gods of Evil and believes that it is her right to one day dominate the entire world. Takhisis is one of the first gods, called along with Paladine. She controls the chromatic dragons and uses them for her conquests, but is always beaten back by the forces of good, evidenced by events like her defeat by Huma Dragonbane with his dragonlance.

Zeboim, also known as the Sea Witch, the Darkling Sea, and the Dragon Turtle, represents the godly force of strife. She encourages souls to give into its urges and release anger. She is the unpredictable and embodies storm and raging sea, which is the element she commands over. Her attitude constantly changes, going from calm to raging in a minute. She wants souls to continually cause anguish and anger, so that they remain active and vital, instead of becoming predictable and stagnant. Sailors and mariners try to calm her during voyages so that she does not make trouble for their vessel. Zeboim is the daughter of Takhisis and Sargonnas. She mothers, through one of her aspects, the founder of the Knights of Takhisis Ariakan, the son of Ariakas. She loves him dearly and when he is killed she damns his slayer Ausric Krell to become a death knight and traps him on an island. She dislikes her mother and father, along with Chemosh, though she works with both her parents on occasion. She ignores Morgion and Nuitari and works with Hiddukel well. She hates or works against the Gods of Neutrality and has a special dislike for Habbakuk, who she sees as her true foe because of his power of the sea.
