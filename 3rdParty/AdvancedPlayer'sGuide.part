    <Prereqs> ~EARTH GNOME </Prereqs>
    <Flavor> Miners, wanderers, and tricksters who dwell either in the wilds or underground, often underestimated until it is far too late. </Flavor>
    <specific name="Size"> Small </specific>
    <specific name="Speed"> 5 squares </specific>
    <specific name="Characteristics"> Easy-going, deceptive, resolute, stubborn, sharing, avaricious, cooperative, tricky </specific>
    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Earth gnomes average slightly over four feet in height, and tend toward wiry or slender builds. While pale earth gnomes are not unheard of, most range toward ruddier or darker skin tones, from the brown hue of some humans to the actual gray of stone. Their hair, too, tends toward dark, though a significant minority instead sport silver or white hair even from a young age. Male earth gnomes tend to grow facial hair, though they are not nearly so obsessive about it as are dwarves. 
	  Earth gnomes age slightly more slowly than their dwarven cousins, reaching maturity just a little older than humans do. They tend to remain healthy and vigorous past 300 years old, and some earth gnomes survive to over 350. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> The majority of earth gnomes (or at least the majority of those who deal with other races) come across as easy going and even fun-loving. That doesn't mean they're incapable of taking things seriously, or that they're constant pranksters, so much that they simply refuse to let life get them down. Even insular earth gnome communities that seek to avoid contact with the outside share such good humor amongst themselves. Because of this attitude, it often surprises others just how strongwilled earth gnomes can be. Once an earth gnome has set his sights on a goal, he can be as tireless as a dwarf, and quick to figure a way past almost any obstacle. 
	  Earth gnomes don't seem to care much about the origins of their race. Some maintain that they descend from creatures of the Feywild, others that they sprung from the earth alongside the dwarves, but all of these are merely matters for discussion, not points of contention. They do, however, take great pride in their extended families and in the accomplishments of their ancestors. To an earth gnome, the greatest honor they can do their forebears is to acknowledge the ancestor's inspiration while striving for ever greater accomplishments. 
	  While individual accomplishments are celebrated, where earth gnomes truly shine is teamwork. To an earth gnome, a family (or adventuring party) accomplishment, toward which everyone has worked, is of far greater value than anything they might achieve alone. Earth gnomes are strong believers in giving credit where it's due, so long as they're granted their own fare share of accolades as well. Like dwarves, earth gnomes often have a strong acquisitive streak, making them seem greedy to outsiders a surprise, given their propensity toward sharing. In truth, however, earth gnomes don't seek wealth for its own sake, but rather for the benefit of their clans or parties, and as a means toward achieving other goals. Even when an earth gnome isn't actively working toward any particular objective, he gathers wealth simply on the off chance he'll need it later, not because he has any real desire to be rich.
	  Where earth gnomes most frequently come into conflict with others is over the art of deception. To an earth gnome, lies, illusions, and deceit are just tools like any other, to be employed in order to achieve their objectives. While an earth gnome isn't likely to lie to a friend what would be the point? - he's also not likely to comprehend quite why so many other races take deception as a personal affront.</specific>

    <specific name="Short Description"> More fey than the dour dwarves but far earthier than the elves or their cousins among the other gnome races, earth gnomes occupy an odd middle ground between worlds. While some earth gnome communities are insular indeed, many earth gnomes are friendly, outgoing, even prankish - a persona that, in combination with their small size, prevents most other races from taking them seriously. Some ignore the attitudes of the larger beings, while others set out to prove themselves, but all earth gnomes take an intense pride in their heritage.</specific>

Play an earth gnome if you want...
- to play a good-hearted trickster whose jovial attitude belies a far more serious side.
- to be both outgoing and determined, someone capable of working toward what he wants under any circumstances.
- to play a spellcaster or an archer capable of launching attacks from surprising positions on the battlefield.
- to play a spellbinder, a warlock, or a wizard.

Earth gnomes have a strange, almost spiritual affinity for tiny burrowing mammals (rabbits, badgers, weasels, and the like). Once per day, all earth gnomes can cast the Commune With Animals ritual without cost, even if they do not formally know it or cannot normally cast rituals. They may only target tiny burrowing mammals when doing so. (Earth gnomes can choose to learn the ritual normally, in order to commune with other animals, but they must meet all prerequisites and pay all costs as normal.)

    <specific name="Size"> Medium </specific>
    <specific name="Speed"> 6 squares </specific>
    <specific name="Characteristics"> Wild, short-tempered, determined, vengeful, honorable (sometimes), powerful, self-reliant, respectful of merit. </specific>
    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Orc-blooded average almost six-and-a-half feet in height, and are reasonably dense for their size. Some are broad and powerful, others lean and wiry, but all are heavily muscled. Most have the gray skin and dark hair of their orc ancestors, though a few are only slightly more dusky-skinned than the average human. Their faces are somewhat bestial, but less apelike than a true orc; a few can even pass as ugly humans. Most let their hair grow wild, but a significant minority prefer tight tails or braids, and many of the males grow facial hair. 
	  Orc-blooded reach maturity slightly earlier than humans. They remain vigorous until their 50s, on those rare occasions when they don't die in battle, and rarely live past the age of 60 or 70. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> As mentioned above, orc-blooded are more than just a mix of human and orc. They're a race of their own, one that breeds true, even to the point where many orc-blooded tribes have their own names for their race. ("Urok" is a common one.) Orc-blooded are strong and quick to anger, but they aren't necessarily either evil or destructive or at least not all of them are. They're also surprisingly observant and knowledgeable of the wilderness, traits bred into them by the constant struggle for survival. 
	  Orc-blooded believe very strongly in personal strength and individual merit. They have powerful traditions and religious beliefs, most of which focus on brutal war gods or totemic spirits, but these traditions are considered to be the guiding wisdom of past generations, not iron-clad rules. An orc-blooded king or war-chief holds power only so long as he proves capable; a shaman's guidance is accepted because he clearly has the favor of divine powers. The notion that someone in authority should be allowed to keep his power purely due to birthright is foreign to most orc-blooded tribes. It"s for this reason as well as the fact that "civilized" peoples seem weak and ignorant in the important ways of the world that many wild orc-blooded tribes snicker at the notion that civilization is a superior way of life. 
	  Many orc-blooded have a strong sense of honor to go with their beliefs in personal merit, but others are pure believers in "might makes right" and the notion that any means of victory and advancement are acceptable. Some orc-blooded tribes trade and interact regularly with villages, city-states, and other "points of light," while others prefer to either avoid such areas, or raid them frequently for wealth, food, and slaves. While one would expect that the more honorable orc-blooded are those most likely to trade peacefully with civilization, this is only sometimes true. Many conflicts between civilized peoples and orc-blooded tribes are fought with surprising honor and fairness (though anyone who assumes a given orc-blooded is going to act with honor, until they've seen it for themselves, deserves what they get). 
	  Despite their warlike natures and great tempers, most orc-blooded have a strong sense of familial bonds. They are quite loyal to their families and tribes, and they take any attack on their people personally. An orcblooded can carry on a lifelong vendetta against those who have harmed his loved ones. When an orc-blooded joins in adventuring party, and fights beside them several times, saving their lives and having his saved in turn, he often comes to think of them as a surrogate family. An orc-blooded or at least any orc-blooded with a sense of honor would no sooner betray his friends and family than he would cut off his own arms.</specific>

    <specific name="Short Description"> Most folks assume that the orc-blooded are all the children of a human and orc pairing, often an unwilling one and that is, indeed, the source of a few members of the race. Most orc-blooded, however, are descendants from days of old, when humans were more primitive and some tribes intermingled with orcs on a regular basis. The line bred true, and in several regions of the wild, clans of orc-blooded exist as their own race.</specific>

Play an Orc-Blooded if you want...
- to be a wild and mighty warrior, more at home in battle than in civilization.
- to cut down your enemies in the name of your clan, your ancestors, or your war gods.
- to defy the expectations and stereotypes of those who would dismiss you as an ignorant savage or to reinforce them.
- to play a savage warrior, a nature priest, a fighter, or a two-weapon ranger.

    <specific name="Physical Qualities"> Like other halflings, shire halflings average 4 feet in height, but they tend to be somewhat heavier, often leaning to portly. A few grow beards, but this is rare most favor clean-shaven faces, or else the traditional long halfling sideburns. They tend to keep their hair cut shorter than traveling halflings, and do not favor the same sorts of ties, tails, and braids. 
	  Shire halflings prefer simple clothing, such as woolen pants and coats, and billowy tunics. Most of their outfits tend toward earth tones and greens, but a few favor bright blues and yellows. Their feet are somewhat larger than those of their cousins, and the tops are covered in a thick mop of fur. Except where absolutely necessary, shire halflings do not wear shoes. 
	  Shire halflings mature at about the same rate as humans, but tend to live in good health until their 80s, and often survive to be over a century old. </specific>
    <specific name="Playing"> Shire halflings are so innocuous, they make even other halflings seem loud and offensive. They prefer isolation, but are friendly enough to passing travelers as long as they don't stay too long. 
	  These small people dwell in the communities after which they are named. Their shires are usually the size of small to moderate villages, and almost always to be found in light forests and rolling hills. Some halfling shires consist of simple wooden homes, while others are dug directly into the sides of hills. Most shires are within a day's travel, or perhaps two, of another community usually a human village. This allows the shire halflings to trade when they need to, but is far enough that they don't have to deal with a constant stream of outsiders. 
	  Very few shire halflings become adventurers. They're a simple, practical people, far more concerned with meeting their daily needs and living in as much peace and comfort as possible than they are with acquiring glory or great wealth. Give a shire halfling a comfortable home, a livelihood that's enthralling without being too difficult, and six or seven square meals a day, and he's normally quite happy. 
	  That said, some shire halflings are indeed driven to adventure, either because they cannot fight the halfling wanderlust that rises up within them, or due to more personal circumstances. Other shire halflings look on these adventurers askance, believing them to be slightly touched in the head and yet, in the backs of their minds, most of them wonder if they would have the courage and fortitude to do what these rare few have done. 
	  Despite their love of comfort, shire halflings are incredibly resilient, capable not only of going without their luxuries, but of surviving hardships that would challenge most humans, and even the occasional dwarf.</specific>

    <specific name="Short Description"> Shire halflings are cousins of the more well known halfling race more closely related than, say, elves and eladrin, but still boasting their share of racial differences. Where other halflings are nomadic traders and river-travelers, shire halflings prefer lives of homey comfort, and view the notion of adventuring with something akin to horror. Yet some of them possess the same wanderlust as their nomadic cousins, a need that drives them, despite their "better judgment," to take up an adventuring lifestyle, at least for a time.</specific>

Play a Shire Halfling if you want...
-to be a reluctant hero, driven to adventure by need or by a wanderlust that you cannot fight no matter how you try.
- to be practical, loyal, and never willing to give up.
- to play an "everyman" sort of character, shaped into a hero by circumstances around him.
- to play a troubadour, an artful dodger rogue, or a fey-pact warlock.

Shire halflings don't travel much, but they're capable of covering substantial ground when forced to. For purposes of determining how much distance you can cover during a day's walk, treat your base speed as 2 higher than normal. (See the D'D 4E Players Handbook.) In addition, when making Endurance checks to avoid damage from hunger, your stamina (and, if you match the stereotypical look of the shire halfling, your extra body weight) allows you to roll twice and choose the higher result.

You gain the Hunter's Form [Wildshaper] power. You assume the form of a normal (that is, realworld) animal. The animal must be a quadruped, and must be within one size category of your natural form. (You can, if necessary, become a giant or abnormally small version of an otherwise normal animal, in order to fit this criteria.) Common forms include wolves, panthers, abnormally large lizards, and smaller bears. Despite the name "hunter," you do not have to become a predatory creature; horses and bulls are viable choices as well. 
* You can resume your humanoid form as a free action at any point during your turn.
* You keep all your normal abilities, stats, and attributes, except as noted here. You cannot speak while in this form (except to communicate with other animals of the same type).
* You gain a basic unarmed attack often a bite, but possibly a kick, a gore, or whatever is appropriate to your form. Although it is a basic physical attack, you may choose to use your Wisdom modifier, rather than Strength, when making it. The attack deals a base of 1d8 points of damage, plus the relevant modifier.
* You gain low-light vision (if you do not already have it) and the scent ability.
* You gain one of the following movement bonuses, depending on your form. (Talk to your GM about which bonus best fits the form you've chosen. Even if a real-world animal would seem to gain more than one of these, you only gain one.)

	Bear 	Climb speed equal to your base land speed
	Great Cat	Climb speed equal to your base land speed
	Horse	Add +2 to your base land speed
	Wolf	Add +2 to your base land speed
	Crocodile	Swim speed equal to your base land speed
	Shark	Swim speed equal to your base land speed
	Badger	Burrow speed equal to half your base land speed
	Giant Rat	Burrow speed equal to half your base land speed
	
* You gain a +2 bonus to Endurance checks to avoid exhaustion.
* If you take on the form of a creature that can breathe water, you may do so as well, but the maximum duration you can maintain the hunter's form is halved.
* You retain the benefits of your armor and other protective magical items. (As mentioned above, your stats don't change.) You cannot make use of other magic items, however.
* You can still cast nature priest prayers (though of course, you do not gain the benefits of your implements, if any).

    <specific name="Level"> 11 </specific>
You suffer no penalties for walking in your chosen terrain, and ignore difficult terrain that naturally occurs in that area. For instance, if your focus is forest, you can walk at full speed or shift over difficult woodland terrain; if glacial, you can walk over ice without falling or slowing; if mountain or underground, you ignore the difficulties of broken or uneven stone floors; and so forth. You must still actually have enough surface on which to walk to use this power. For instance, while a marsh-focused guardian is unslowed by the mud or shallow waters of the swamp, he is still impeded by water too deep to walk through, and must swim or find other means of travel accordingly.

You firmly believe that stealth and secrecy are the roads to victory but an army, a team, or an adventuring party are only as stealthy as their clumsiest member. Whether you're devoted to a government, a guild, or simply a party of allies, you're determined to guide their efforts, gathering information and sneaking past sentries no matter how loud the paladin's armor might be ringing.

Nearly all assassins are skilled at stealth and killing, but you have elevated them to an art form. You might be a cold-blooded killer for hire, or you might serve a higher purpose, eliminating the enemies of your guild, your king, or your Church. Whatever the case, however, you're a strong believer in striking from the dark, and in killing before the target has the chance to strike back.

    <specific name="Level"> 11 </specific>
When you cast an arcane spell with the same keyword as your Arcane Affinity, you ignore up to 10 points of the target's resistance. For instance, if you chose Necrotic for your Arcane Affinity, and then cast a necrotic spell at a creature with resist 15 necrotic, it would effectively have only resist 5 necrotic against your spells. This does not help you against creatures with actual immunity, however.

You enable yourself to speak with a specific animal, and to gain answers to your questions. The animal need not be present when you cast the ritual, but you must designate what type of animal you wish to speak to. And of course, you'll need to locate or attract an animal of that type before the duration of the ritual expires. 
Most animals are, obviously, not particularly intelligent. They know what they've seen in the recent past. They answer your questions to the best of their ability, but they cannot understand abstract concepts, and they don't count very well.

Your Nature check result determines the number of questions you can ask.

&lt;table&gt;Nature Check Result	Questions Allowed
9 or lower	Zero
10-19	One
20-29	Two
30 or higher	Three&lt;/table&gt;

At the GM's option, questioning the animal might require a skill challenge, using either Diplomacy, or Nature in place of Diplomacy.

You generate an aura of magic that transforms the water around you into a lighter, breathable substance. It remains a liquid, not true air, but you and all creatures within are still capable of breathing normally. When within the sphere, you can move through the water at a speed equal to your normal base movement, and can do so in all directions, but you cannot run. You can cause a number of willing companions to move along with the sphere as many as can reasonably fit in the sphere's diameter. Aquatic creatures outside the area of Air Bubble can see the perimeter of the bubble, and most avoid it if possible. Aquatic creatures cannot breathe within the sphere, but they can swim through it if necessary.

The sphere does not impede any incoming attacks. Any attacks you or your companions make against creatures within, or immediately adjacent to, the bubble are not impeded by being underwater. Attacks against creatures farther away than this are impeded normally. Any actions you take within the bubble are also unimpeded, and function just as if you were on the ground.

Your Nature check determines the duration and size of the bubble.

    <specific name="type"> Ritual </specific>
With this ritual, you can alter the contours of a natural area of ground. The region must be dirt, soil, sand, clay, loose rock, or the like. You cannot move or collapse true rock formations, ground made up of solid rock, or a manufactured floor. This ritual does not violently break the surface of the ground. Instead, it creates wavelike crests and troughs, with the earth reacting with glacier-like fluidity until the desired result is achieved. Trees, structures, rock formations, and such are mostly unaffected except for changes in elevation and relative topography.

You can use this ritual to collapse embankments, shift the locations of dune and small hillocks, create moats and pits, or raise defensive bastions. It cannot be used for tunneling, though you could create a winding passage both relatively shallow and open to the air. The changes in topography last for 24 hours, and then slowly resume their previous shape. However, if you've already changed the earth with this ritual, you can maintain those changes by casting a much shorter and cheaper rite as the 24 hour deadline approaches. (These are the figures given in parenthesis, above.) This does not require any additional nature check, and the use of this maintenance ritual extends the duration for another 24 hours.

Your Nature check determines the total amount of area you can alter.

&lt;table&gt;Nature Check Result	Maximum Size of Area
19 or lower	10-square burst
21-29	20-square burst
30-39	30-square burst
40 or higher	40-square burst&lt;/table&gt;

The above figures assume a maximum change in elevation of 2 squares in either direction. (That is, portions of the area can be made 10 feet deeper, or 10 feet higher.) For each additional square of elevation change, if you wish to make an area or barrier higher or lower, reduce the area's maximum size by one category on the table above. For instance, if you rolled a 35 on your check, you could manipulate a 30-square burst by up to 2 squares vertically; a 20-square burst by up to 3 squares vertically, or a 10-square burst by up to 4 squares vertically.

Any walls or barriers you create with this ritual have the following statistics per square of thickness: break DC 25; AC 5, Reflex 5, Fortitude 10, 20 hp; Athletics check DC 15 to climb.

    <specific name="type"> Ritual </specific>
You create the illusion of a number of objects, using them to alter the appearance of the region as you prefer. You can use this ritual to create an illusory wall, tree, statue, shrub, or other object. Each object created by the ritual can be between Small and Large size; you can, if you like, include one or two Huge objects among them, but this cuts the number of total images you can create by half.

Each image must appear within a set area, measured in a number of squares from the point where you cast the ritual. Within that space, you may place them as you like.

Your arcana check determines the base DC of Insight checks to recognize the illusion as false and to establish the number of illusions, and the size of the area.

&lt;table&gt;Arcana Check Result	Number of Images
19 or lower	2 images
21-29	4 images
30-39	6 images
40 or higher	8 images&lt;/table&gt;

Once you create the illusion, you cannot move it, nor can it feature complex moving parts (though very slight movements, such as leaves rustling with a light breeze, are possible).

Creatures that view or interact with an illusion are entitled to Insight checks to detect the fact that it is false (DC 15 + your level). A creature is allowed a check the first time it sees the illusion and each time it interacts with it. A creature that touches an illusion automatically determines that the image is a fake, but this grants it no benefit to determining that any of the other objects you created are fake.

While walking "between the worlds" in this manner, you cover substantially more ground, taking advantage of both the intrinsic magic of the Feywild and the differences in terrain between the two worlds. For the duration of the ritual, multiply your overland travel distances by 5. You must emerge from another tree, so if your destination is a wasteland a desert, for instance, or a glacier the GM may determine that you cannot use this spell to travel the entire distance.

You can bring along up to 12 willing creatures. This ritual only functions when cast in the natural world. Your Nature check determines the duration of the ritual.

First Failed Save: Target is dazed instead of slowed (save ends).
Second failed Save: The target transforms into a small animal (and is no longer dazed). The precise form of the animal is your choice, it could be a large cat, a dog, a hawk, or the like. The target retains its own hit points, and its movement rate depends on its form (a hawk can fly, for instance; your GM will decide the precise movement based on shape), but otherwise, use the statistics for a dire rat (or a similar animal no more potent than a level 1 minion). The target becomes an animal mentally as well, and almost certainly seeks to do nothing but escape combat. Once it has become an animal, the target can no longer save against this power; only the Remove Affliction ritual can restore it to its original form and persona. If you attempt to turn the target into an animal that cannot survive the current environment, such as transforming it into a fish in the middle of a forest, you take a -4 penalty on the attack roll, and the target gains a +2 bonus to its saves. </specific>

With a move action, you can also direct it to move up to 6 squares before or after a charge attack. The bulls move as physical creatures; they must go around obstacles and foes (though they may move through your allies' squares), are slowed by difficult terrain, and must end their move in unoccupied squares. While the bulls must end every move in the space of a single Gargantuan creature (a space four squares by four squares), they can split up while moving, so you could, for instance, have the herd go around an enemy on both sides.</specific>
    <specific name="Special"> Although the power specifies that the conjuration takes the form of a heard of bulls, you can cause it to take the form of other herd animals, such as stallions, buffaloes, or drakes or it can take on the form of a single Gargantuan creature, such as an enormous macetail behemoth or a mighty war elephant. </specific>

    <specific name="Effect"> You immediately recognize any illusions in the area, from simple illusory spells like disguise self to the creations of illusion rituals, as false, and detect the presence and location of invisible creatures. This doesn't automatically allow you to see through the illusions, and you still suffer a penalty for attacking invisible creatures, but you know them for what, and where, they are. If a Perception (or other) check is allowed to see the truth behind the illusion, you gain a +10 bonus to that check. </specific>

    <specific name="Effect"> You create a duplicate of yourself within range. The double of yourself is entirely illusory, but appears, sounds, and even smells like you in all respects. Any time you take an action, you can choose whether the "real you" performs it, or the duplicate. In other words, as a move action, you can move your normal movement rate, or you can have the double move your normal movement rate. As a standard action, you can cast a spell and have it come from you, or have it come from the double. You can see through the double's eyes, so if you have the double cast a spell at a target, the double, not you, must have line of sight and line of effect. You may speak and hear via the double. (The double does not grant you extra actions, so you must decide, with each action, whether it's being performed by you or the double.) 
The double has the same AC and defenses as you do. It does not benefit from any defense spells you cast on yourself, and you do not benefit from any defensive spells you cast on the double.
You can only cast arcane spells through the double; even if you have access to martial, divine, or other powers, you cannot have the double use them, nor can the double make basic attacks or cast rituals. The double cannot cast arcane spells that require a melee attack, nor can it manipulate solid objects, since it has no substance.
Since the double moves at your speed, you can cause it to move quite some distance away from you. You do not need to maintain line of sight or line of effect to the double.</specific>
    <specific name="Sustain Minor"> You can sustain the illusion for up to five minutes. If the double is hit by any attack or effect that causes damage, the spell ends immediately, and you are dazed until the end of your next turn. </specific>

    <specific name="Hit (Any)"> If the attack hits, the target is restrained inside the cage (save ends; the cage disappears at this time). </specific>
    <specific name="Special"> The target may not attempt a save against the slowed, ongoing fire, or dazed effects until after the cage disappears (either due to a successful save against the restrained condition, because you fail to sustain the power, or it's dispelled). </specific>
