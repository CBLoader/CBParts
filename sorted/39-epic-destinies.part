It is your destiny to stand against the encroaching darkness that threatens to overwhelm the world. You started with battles against goblins and kobolds, but as time passed and your skill grew you faced ever more dangerous foes. Now, you understand that your fate rests far beyond the borders of the lands you have defended. Great powers from other planes threaten the world, and it is up to you to endure their attacks and end their menace forever.
	As an Indomitable Champion, you are almost impossible to sway from your quest. Drawing on reserves of vitality, energy, and vigor, you push on despite your enemies' efforts. Destiny has chosen you to achieve some great deed, and as an epic hero you soldier on despite the obstacles and foes you face.

The world has seen many empires, but all of them have fallen to treachery from within and enemies from without. You realize that if the world is ever to be safeguarded against evil, the old empires must arise again. It is your destiny to defeat the cosmic forces—be they deities, demon lords, or archdevils—that conspire to crush civilization.
As a Destined Scion, you take the fight to the enemies of the mortal world. In battle, you are stern and resolute. Your foes' attacks cannot stop you, and when the time comes to deliver a killing blow, your attack strikes true.

Upon completion of your final quest, you disappear, leaving only dust, as you are entirely absorbed by your deity. You become part of it, aware of what happens in the world around you, but unable to participate while your deity is still dead.
	Perhaps your sacrifice rejuvenates the dead deity, or it might increase the activity of the deity's cult, giving it a chance at resurrection in the future. If your deity is brought back, you return as its avatar. As its most loyal servant, you might yet play a role in the future of the faith. </specific>

When you follow this destiny, you begin to transform into an avatar of your dead deity, but at a price. As you leech power from your deity, your soul slowly dwindles and rekindles glimmers of the deity's consciousness. You gain considerable power and mental resilience but sacrifice some of your life force to earn that power.
	As this connection grows stronger, you also become more attuned to the lingering echoes of your deity's feelings and thoughts. You come as close to being one entity as is possible, and this brings the realization that you must surrender your individuality to ever bring your power to the next level and achieve the return of your deity—or, if you prefer, your transformation into a deity.

Your spirit is accustomed to plumbing the depths of the Astral Sea, and it returns there when death beckons. With its last flicker, your spirit can gather the dissipating essence of your dead deity and fuse it into the spark of life. While this process appears to take only moments to your friends, to you it feels as if you were adrift for days or weeks. When you make death saving throws during an encounter, any successful saving throw has the same effect as if you had rolled a 20. If you have no healing surges, you regain hit points equal to your healing surge value. Once this feature is used, it can't be used again until after you have taken an extended rest.

Your ceaseless drive to learn and your devotion to Ioun has enabled you to attain a status few others can claim. As a Sage of the Swan Tower, you have gained access to the glorious Halls of Enlightenment and can call upon its infinite knowledge. You, however, are not like the other sages. You find the traditional method of learning through reading to be insufficient and spend much of your time in the field, acquiring new knowledge and testing theories.
    Each new nugget of information—each new revelation—brings you closer to the goal that you have held in your heart for so long. You feel the call of Ioun as you achieve greater feats of discovery and demystify new layers of knowledge. Eventually your dream becomes reality, and you are invited to become one of the timeless sages of the Swan Tower.
    Life among your fellow sages in Kerith-Ald is all you hoped it would be, yet you see more potential for yourself every time you visit the Pillars of Ioun. It has been a long time since Ioun has honored one of her sages in such a way. Perhaps with some perseverance you can come to deserve your own alabaster monument.

As a Guardian of the Void, your destiny is tied to those who hope to unlock the power of the Echoing Void. Perhaps you crossed paths early, fighting a minor skirmish that later proved to be one of the first steps in beginning the ritual. A guardian has little knowledge of this destiny, assuming its mantle only when the ritual nears its final stages. You might find that a few disparate events come together to paint a terrifying pattern—one that you must disrupt.
	A Guardian of the Void fights to prevent the Echoing Void's completion, to destroy all knowledge of the ritual, and to defeat those who would pursue the power it offers. By the time a guardian arises, the threat posed to the cosmos is both dire and imminent. You will face down the servants of the powerful creature that seeks to complete the Echoing Void, preparing for your final battle. </specific>

The Shadowfell is a realm of death, the one thing in the universe that unifies all mortal folk, from the lowliest beggar to the mightiest emperor. Even the gods are vulnerable to death's sting. During the Dawn War between the gods and the primordials, many deities fell in battle. Since that time, gods have died at the hands of demons and even mortals.
	Some creatures seek to escape death's grasp. A wizard walks the dark path of lichdom to attain immortality. An alchemist brews a secret elixir that will extend his life by centuries. Such creatures only delay the inevitable. Others, however, take a more direct approach to avoiding their fate.
	Scattered pieces of lore, some dating back to the time before the Dawn War, suggest that death is not an intrinsic part of the cosmic order. By performing a dark ritual known as the Echoing Void, creatures intent on immortality at any cost can overcome death—but only by sacrificing millions of sentient lives.
	The signs of preparation for this ritual are unmistakable. For a creature that seeks to create devastation on such a massive scale, the options are few—perhaps smashing an astral dominion or annihilating an entire region of the world. Secrecy rather than overwhelming power is such a villain's primary tool, since the pursuit of the Echoing Void is bound to draw the wrath of heroes, gods, fiends, and primordials alike.
	When the ritual of the Echoing Void is begun, the magic it gathers spawns an equal and opposite reaction. The cosmos anoints champions to oppose the ritual's master. These powerful heroes become the Guardians of the Void, dedicated to preventing the wholesale destruction of the established order of death and life.

	First and foremost among these opponents are the servants of the Raven Queen. Her legions of shadar-kai and sorrowsworn hunt you unceasingly, but their wrath is only a foreshadowing of the eventual confrontation between you and the god of death. When that final conflict comes, you will lead the Raven Queen back into the everflow—by force if necessary—so that she might be reborn and attain the enlightenment she has denied herself and all other creatures. </specific>

A constant stream of spirits passes through the Shadowfell—part of a grand procession of life, death, and rebirth known to a few ascetics as the everflow. Those who believe in the everflow also believe that it was once intended to return souls back to the world for a new lease on life. According to legend, the dread god Nerull usurped the everflow by hoarding the spirits of the dead. His successor, the Raven Queen, only partly undid the damage done by the fallen god, cutting the everflow short and passing judgment on mortal souls as she sees fit.
	The select few who have glimpsed this truth have chosen to correct the course of the everflow. To do this, the Keepers of the Everflow must find a mighty construct hidden deep in the darklands of the Shadowfell—the great Spirit Wheel, set in motion by the actions of the first Keepers. If they complete their work, the everflow will trickle away from the Raven Queen's domain as the procession of souls is redirected from the road to Letherna back into the world. The existence of the Keepers of the Everflow is an affront to the god of death, and she will stop at nothing until the faithful of this upstart order are all held in her wintry grasp.

	Of all the dangers to Letherna, none rank higher than Orcus, Demon Prince of Undeath.

Letherna lies deep in the Shadowfell, far beyond the reach of most mortals. This bastion of the Raven Queen is seen only by the spirits of the dead and by the privileged retainers and bodyguards of the god of death. Those loyal to the Raven Queen stand ready to defend her citadel's frost-covered walls from any threat.
	Ages ago, when the Raven Queen struck down the dread god Nerull, the other deities crafted a pact that changed the nature of the gods' relationship with death. To prevent the recently ascended queen from hoarding the spirits of the dead as her own personal army, the pact stipulated that the Raven Queen would be the god of death but not god of the dead, serving as a custodian of the natural cycle of life and death. In return, the gods would allow the Raven Queen to enlist their own followers to aid her worshipers in the defense of her realm. This arrangement suited the Raven Queen, herself an ascended mortal, who preferred to deal with mortals more than with the uncaring powers of the Astral Sea.
	That call of duty has sounded again. The armies of Letherna have need of commanders, and only the greatest heroes can be entrusted with the sanctity of the afterlife. With grim determination, the Marshals of Letherna pick up the Raven Queen's banner and stand fast in the defense of her bastion.

All mortals have a dark road ahead of them in the afterlife. When their spirits are released from the flesh they were born into, they venture into the Shadowfell to make their way to the cold slopes of Letherna—and to whatever final destination awaits beyond the halls of the Raven Queen. However, some souls linger in the mortal realm, unable or unwilling to take this fateful journey. Entities such as ghosts, specters, wraiths, and devourers are the most dangerous of these hesitant spirits, committing atrocities through malicious intent or mindless despair.
	In response to this scourge, the greatest and wisest heroes of the world are called by fate and the Raven Queen to serve as the Twilight Tribunes. These selfless champions dedicate their lives to seeking out and destroying wayward incorporeal souls. By invoking their dread judgment, the Twilight Tribunes allow even the most tormented undead to leave their lives and pain behind. As they follow the path of their destiny, the Twilight Tribunes are drawn to ever more powerful creatures and challenges, working their way through the most fearsome creatures of shadow and undeath. Having dispensed with liches, dracoliches, and vampires, a tribune might be called on in the end to face off against beings of godlike power and the greatest lords of the undead.

Few heroes have borne the name Witch Queen (or Witch King), but those few have inspired awe, fear, and dread.
	These beings become living legends, the stock character in the myths, fairy tales, and horror stories of every race, as awe-inspiring as they are terrifying. Those who have accepted this mantle have learned to incorporate their power into their being, no longer treating it as a source separate from their form.
	Before becoming a Witch Queen, those who aspired to fill the role were conflicted between three aspects: one's power, one's familiar, and one's self. But when one becomes a king or queen of all witches, these aspects merge, allowing a Witch Queen or Witch King to bring forth spells as easily as if his or her familiar had whispered the arcane words directly into their ear. These individuals are near equals to their patrons in power, and armies clamor to their banners, while mortals and immortals alike seek their counsel to beg their favor or plead for their mercy.

Deep in the Feywild, far from the stately halls of the eladrin, a tradition has been upheld for eons. In shadowy forests thick with moss and undergrowth, the baying of hunting hounds sounds, followed by the long strides of their masters. As storm clouds cover the sky, the forest is no longer a realm of bedtime stories or folk tales. It becomes the province of the Wild Hunt.
	The tradition of the Wild Hunt originated among the firbolgs, fey giants devoted to the moon and the Three Fates, personified by Sehanine (the Maiden), Melora (the Mother), and the Raven Queen (the Crone). The firbolgs call for a Wild Hunt when they seek to punish an oath breaker, for oaths are powerful things in the Feywild. Some mortals, their trust betrayed by the Unseelie fey, have learned to summon these eldritch hunters to bring down those who wronged them. A select few learn the ritual for summoning the hunters, but instead of asking for justice, request to learn the secrets of the Wild Hunt. Such requests are rarely accepted, but a worthy few learn the ways of the Wild Hunt, bringing retribution to all traitors and oath breakers.

You have become a legend among legends, and your anointment as a Shiradi Champion echoes throughout the world.

Mortals call your name out at fey crossings, seeking your might against enemies equally legendary. It is your burden to help them, thus spreading the influence of the Court of Stars.
	Your greatest task is the defense of the Court of Stars from those who would see it torn asunder. You and your allies stand against cyclops warlords, mad fomorian kings, and dreadful hags, beating back their advances and recovering the lands lost during centuries of battle. In time, you might even receive a request for aid from the Queen of Summer to face down her own son, the Prince of Frost, mightiest of the Winter Fey. You strive to be ready for the task.

Myriad archfey band together several times a year at the congress known as the Court of Stars, where they engage in diplomacy, schemes, marriages, betrayals, and legendary revels. Although dozens of lesser factions make up the Court of Stars, they mostly acknowledge the leadership of Her Summer Majesty, Queen Tiandra. And the Queen of Summer, when the need arises, turns to her anointed warriors for the defense of her subjects and allies. These warriors are known as Shiradi Champions, the shields of the fey.
	Whereas eladrin nobles might rise through the ranks of coures, bralanis, ghaeles, and other complex titles, Shiradi Champions are usually individuals who have earned the respect and trust of Queen Tiandra. Archfey of all courts assemble at Senaliesse to bear witness to a champion's anointing. Some eye these protectors with suspicion, arrogance, or envy, but their pettiness is ill placed. Each Shiradi Champion is devoted to the lovely Queen of Summer and determined to justify her trust.
	Some eladrin Shiradi Champions are also shiere knights (see Player's Handbook 2). A very few champions are not born as one of the fey, and their ascendancy to the role of Shiradi Champion is an unprecedented event, a testament to the champion's unique valor and great worth. Whatever path a champion takes, he or she is assuredly an ally and protector of good-natured fey beings everywhere.

There is no full accounting of the primordials sealed away in the Elemental Chaos and elsewhere in the planes. Their roster is endless, their exploits too terrible to dwell upon. They are too powerful to die, too dangerous to live. The gods sealed them in the deepest depths to ensure that they would trouble the planes no more. During their imprisonment, the primordials have never ceased their efforts to escape and to resume the struggle against the gods they hate.
	In exploring elemental magic, you have been touched by a primordial's essence. Perhaps only a dream has settled in your mind, or maybe a shard of a fallen primordial became lodged inside you. When you attain the epic tier, the shard awakens and begins merging its identity with yours until one day you become like a primordial.

Long ago, an ancient race of mighty sorcerers abandoned the material world for the Elemental Chaos, drawn by the plane's infinite mutability. These were the Reigar, a humanlike people who revered personal freedom, expression, and artistry above all other values. In time they mastered the secrets of immortality and became a race of godlings in mortal form-self-centered, capricious, driven only by the desire to experience new sensations and outdo each other in creative works. Foreseeing that their race would eventually dwindle and stagnate, the Reigar created one last masterwork of cooperative magic: a sentient, self-guiding force that would seek out the most brilliant and worthy souls among mortals and gift them with the powers of the Reigar, thus renewing the race across the ages.
	In the course of your mortal adventures, you have developed into that one person in a million who embodies the exquisitely rare mix of brilliance, beauty, willfulness, and creativity that characterizes the immortal ranks of the Reigar. The ancient lore of the Reigar has revealed itself to you and given you the ability to shape the world to suit your whims.

As you performed ever greater deeds throughout the cosmos, uniting the scattered humans of the world into a new empire greater even than Nerath, more and more have called you lord-even savior. And as those who look to you for leadership multiply, the whispers begin that you are more than human. Not only are you set apart from mortals, but your destiny is to ascend even further, beyond the petty concerns of the material world. This ascension will mark not only your own greatness, but also that of the civilization you champion.
	At first you remain a physical presence in the capital of your realm, guiding your governors and generals with a firm hand, but over time your laws and commandments take on their own life. The leaders of your society increasingly divine your will from this body of knowledge rather than hearing it from your lips, while your focus gradually moves to the planes-spanning affairs of gods and demigods. Eventually, you fade from the world and join their ranks, a great patron invoked in ceremonies and on holy days, to whom the greatest achievements of your civilization are dedicated.

Your origin changes to immortal, and you cease to age.  You gain the ability to speak Supernal, resist 15 fire, and resist 15 radiant. You are immune to fear.
	You gain a pair of angelic wings, which you can manifest or conceal as a minor action.  While your wings are manifested, you can fly at a speed equal to your speed + 2, but you land at the end of your turn.  If your turn ends while you are still flying, you swiftly descend and land without taking falling damage.  While your wings are concealed, your angelic nature is hidden, and you resemble the mortal you once were.
	If you already have wings from some other source (such as the favored soul paragon path; see page 23), these angelic wings take the place of the wings you previously gained.
