You are a monster, fated and infected by a vile curse that transformed you into a creature of nightmare. Normal emotions have become alien to you. Only cold, gnawing hunger remains.
	Most of those who become vampires are victims of monstrous attacks, created by a callous hunter who drained them dry of blood and life force, then cast them aside. Others seek out this path from their own fear of infirmity and death, discovering the arcane rites and alchemical formulas that promise dark power. In some cases, a character finds his or her vampirism invoked by an ancient family curse, or that he or she is a member of an extended clan of vampires who pass their blood down to those they deem worthy&#x2014;whether by choice or not.
	Whatever their origins, vampire characters are not slaves to their creators. Even those beholden to an older vampire retain free will, and have a chance to avoid sinking into the bestial depravity so common among their kind. Vampire characters are the most exceptional examples of those who carry this dark curse, using their powers not solely for murder and personal gain. Some become the greatest of heroes, but even those vampires are aware that few among the common folk have the ability to see past the frightening reality of their dark nature. Avoiding the scrutiny of superstitious folk and disguising his or her needs and abilities serves a vampire best. Trusted companions, enemies to slay and feast upon, and reasons to avoid civilized areas for extended times make an adventuring life the perfect choice for such characters.

  <Flavor> Executioners have a long history with poison. All become masters at mixing their own poisons. For most assassins, poison is only one of their many weapons. Most of the poisons used by executioners are merely the set-up for a later attack, a precursor to ensure that the target won&apos;t be able to stop the executioner once the assassination attempt begins in earnest.
	Many poisons are outlawed in civilized realms, so executioners learn to craft simple, unstable venoms that quickly break down into inert components. In this manner, an assassin can travel with a seemingly innocent array of materials. When it is time to strike, the executioner quickly crafts a poison as needed. Because the poison is unstable, it decays rapidly and leaves no incriminating evidence if unused. A shrewd executioner can maintain an innocent facade even in the face of a thorough search of his or her person and quarters. </Flavor>

You gain the benefit of the Poison Use class feature, with the following exception. You do not start with access to any poison recipes. When you gain a daily attack power, you can instead opt to learn a poison recipe. When you replace a daily attack power, you can instead replace one of your poison recipes with one of a higher level or with a daily attack power from your other hybrid class. The recipe&apos;s level must be less than or equal to your level. For each daily attack power you forgo, you can prepare one poison per day.

When you can choose an encounter attack power that has a level, you can choose the hybrid version of assassin&apos;s strike instead. This power counts as assassin&apos;s strike for purposes of feats and paragon path features. If you already have assassin&apos;s strike and already have an encounter attack power from your other hybrid class, then instead of choosing or replacing an encounter attack power, you can increase the extra damage dealt by your assassin&apos;s strike by 1d10.

The world knows paladins to be shining paragons who champion lofty ideals such as compassion, nobility, sacrifice, and valor. Such virtuous figures are symbols to the common people, icons from which they draw the strength and courage to stand fast against the encroaching darkness. Yet in every light a shadow lurks - the brightness of these noble warriors is equaled by the shadow spreading from their sinister counterparts.

The world demands order. Chaos is a cancer, undermining civilization&apos;s advance, fomenting crimes, sowing discord, and encouraging upheaval. Understanding the world&apos;s crying need, you crusade for order at any cost. When necessary, you enforce your will harshly, making examples of the disobedient.
	Good and evil are methods, not ends - they can both bring stability. You might attempt to serve the greater good even if your methods can be harsh. To channel your vice, you might seek out the basest threats to stability, such as demons, marauding monsters, and other chaotically minded evildoers. Only evil blackguards give in to true tyranny, destroying the hearts and minds of subjects to make certain they obey every command.
	Within a group, you push for ideas that involve imposing order on the situation most efficiently. You might have little tolerance for disorganization, even if such a state encourages freedom. You support authority, acknowledging the most effective leader of a group you&apos;re in even if that individual is not you. However, you expect a leader to handle situations competently or to step down. Dominance is earned, not claimed.
	Alignment: You must be unaligned or evil to focus on the vice of domination. Good can confuse the issue of order and authority, and chaos is unacceptable.
	Once per round while you have temporary hit points, you can take a free action to deal damage to yourself right before making an attack roll against a target. The damage equals your Charisma modifier. You then gain a bonus to the damage roll against the target. The bonus equals the damage you took.

Anger is a common emotion on the battlefield. It&apos;s perfectly natural to feel fury when enemies kill a friend or when a traitor betrays you and your companions. Frustration is bound to arise when a foe slips away or an objective remains out of reach. Such rage is hardly a vice.
	Fury&apos;s dark side arises when it occludes thought, when it rules action, and when it harms without thought for the consequences. Blackguards who indulge in their fury run the risk of losing control and striking out at anyone in their path. Guilt and innocence become meaningless concepts to a warrior in fury&apos;s throes. Such paladins can work terrible acts when consumed by their passions.
	When fury is your vice, you might be temperamental and violent. You could erupt at the slightest provocation, resorting to hostility to solve your problems. Or you might make every effort to maintain control when you need to, letting the hound of fury loose only when it is needed. Even then, if pushed too far, you risk exploding. If you aim to keep your fury under control, your biggest fear is hurting someone or something you value.
	Alignment: You can embrace the vice of fury as long as you are not lawful good. Most heroic blackguards of fury are unaligned. Rage clouds philosophical positions and overshadows peaceable solutions.
	While you have combat advantage against an enemy, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls. The bonus increases to +4 while you are bloodied or adjacent to a bloodied creature.

Some warriors fight for gold. Others seek glory, power, or prestige. There are a few, however, who seek the warrior&apos;s path for reasons that transcend the material and mundane. Called by divine powers to stand as champions of the light against the ever-encroaching darkness, paladins fight not because they choose to, but because, deep within their souls, they know they must. The paladin&apos;s life is not a choice. It is a destiny.
     Paladins are holy warriors, defenders of good and enemies of evil. Paladins are well trained with their weapons and armor, but they augment that skill with divine powers that allow them to shield their allies and smite their enemies. A single paladin can turn the tide of an entire war through a combination of skill at arms and inspiring leadership. As icons of virtue and heroism, paladins are a deadly threat to those who would rule through fear, intimidation, and violence.
     Paladins typically wander the land either alone or in small groups. They seek out wrongs to right and villainy to defeat. Most paladins begin as squires to more experienced holy warriors. Through training and arduous tests, a squire&apos;s bravery, battle skill, and ethics are all tested to see if the squire is worthy of becoming a paladin.
     A cavalier is a paladin who has embraced one of the heroic virtues, such as compassion, justice, sacrifice, or valor. His or her belief in this virtue is so strong that it manifests as divine magic. Although many cavaliers pledge their faith to the gods, others follow no specific religion. Regardless of one&apos;s divine affiliation (or lack thereof), a cavalier&apos;s virtue stands paramount. It guides his or her actions, pointing to the best way to protect the ever-flickering light of hope and civilization in the world.
	 Opposing the cavaliers and the virtues that they champion are the blackguards, who embody the dreaded vices that the cavaliers stand against. Where cavaliers embrace compassion, justice, sacrifice, and valor, blackguards epitomize fury, tyranny, greed, and terror. Since the earliest days of history, these two factions have fought each other. Both wander the land, gathering allies and working to further the cause of their virtues or vices.
     At one time, cavaliers formed into chivalrous orders that were dedicated to the ideal of protecting the civilized realms. The forgotten kingdoms that ruled the land relied on cavaliers to help keep the peace. Those cavaliers maintained not only the military security of the land, but also its moral strength. A cavalier might drive off a marauding troll, but she could also mediate a dispute between two farmers, break the power of a corrupt noble, or free a wrongly accused prisoner.
     As with many things from the time of the forgotten kingdoms, the cavaliers&apos; glory proved fleeting. The kingdoms of old grew weak, and some of their decline could be laid at the feet of cavaliers who strayed from the righteous path. All too often, cavaliers fell victim to the very evils they had sworn to combat. Power corrupts, and in many cases cavaliers served as perfect examples of how power can twist the most resolute heart.
     The grand orders of cavaliers have long since faded, but their glory is not forgotten. Even as evil casts its shadow across the land, there are those who hear the call to the cavalier&apos;s path. Many of the cavaliers of old strayed from their purpose, but that purpose and the power behind it remains strong for those who stay true to it.

    <Prereqs> Cavalier </Prereqs>
    <print-prereqs> Cavalier </print-prereqs>
    <Flavor> A cavalier of sacrifice gives up his or her own safety to shield others from harm. Such a paladin shoulders injuries to keep comrades unharmed and compels enemies to strike him or her first, rather than the paladin&apos;s allies. By invoking divine magic, such cavaliers can sacrifice their vitality and strength to protect those who are weaker, and they gladly do so.
     A cavalier of sacrifice must be ready to give up anything - money, status, power, or life itself - to defend those too weak to shield themselves from evil. Cavaliers of sacrifice are renowned because of the hardships they endure for the good of others. You sleep in a stable while your allies rest in an inn, to save a few coins for the poor. You wear little more than simple, peasant&apos;s garb when not in armor and are an ascetic devoted to your cause, willing to endure any ill or pain to prevent others from suffering it.
     Even though the virtue of sacrifice carries a heavy cost, you must temper your actions with humility. You give up so much, but that sacrifice does not make you more noble than others. Pride is your enemy, because it threatens to lead you to arrogance and ultimately disdain for those you protect. Cavaliers of sacrifice who fall to evil become even more villainous due to the great distance they tumble.</Flavor>

    <Prereqs> Cavalier </Prereqs>
    <print-prereqs> Cavalier </print-prereqs>
    <Flavor> A cavalier of valor focuses on martial prowess and aggressive attacks against enemies. He or she brings the fight to foes, protecting allies by forcing enemies to respond to divine attacks. The virtue of valor emphasizes unflinching bravery in the face of a powerful enemy, and bards&apos; stories are filled with tales of cavaliers of valor who lived up to the name, riding out to challenge dragons, demon lords, and other mighty champions of evil.
     On the battlefield, you are the pinnacle of bravery. You stand resolute against any foe, from a seemingly endless wave of kobolds to a mountain-shaking titan. Without valor, the other virtues lose meaning and impact. To stand against a daunting foe or to hold tight to the exacting standards of the order of cavaliers both of these tasks require faultless valor. You stand at the forefront of a battle, taking the vanguard position to both strike at your foes and shield your allies from your enemies&apos; most ferocious attacks. In this manner, your adherence to valor ensures that your bravery serves as a stirring example.
     Valor must be tempered with wisdom. The valorous cavalier does not fight for the sake of fighting, but for the just cause. Valor turns to bloodlust when a cavalier fails to see that skill at arms is only one solution. Tales abound of valorous cavaliers who have fallen to evil. They didn&apos;t abandon their virtue, but rather lost the wisdom needed to wield it for good. </Flavor>

The world experiences perpetual cycles of life, death, and rebirth. The four seasons are signposts that mark the world&apos;s progress through time, each with its own recognizable traits. The mortal races have learned to live in harmony with this cycle, using the bounty of spring, summer, and autumn to enable them to endure the desolation of winter. In you, that harmony manifests itself in a special way. You have learned to harness the greatest power of the natural world: that of primal magic.
     Druids are guardians of the world. They provide guidance to the common folk and tend to villages, towns, and vast stretches of unspoiled land in the same way that a gardener keeps watch over his flowers and vegetables. A druid works to ensure that the natural order remains strong. A wise druid allows a band of hunting goblins to gather food and game for their survival. But if those same goblins wreak havoc purely for the joy of destruction, the druid calls upon primal magic to smite and scatter them. As long as creatures live within the cycle of nature, a druid lives and lets live.
     Druids provide guidance and protection to farmers, wild animals, and plants in equal measure. In a druid&apos;s eyes, all living creatures have the same right to live within the world. A druid might help a village plant crops, but then turn against the villagers if they hunt to near extinction the wolves that prey on their cattle. Balance is the key to maintaining nature&apos;s integrity.

You gain two of the following abilities of your choice.

Beast Empathy:
The beasts of the wilderness see and know most of what unfolds in their realm. Few folk heed them, but you have learned to understand and interpret their actions and attitudes. Your woodcraft is short of the magical ability to communicate with animals directly, but it is enough to reveal secrets that others miss.
   *You gain a +2 bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks against beasts. You can communicate simple concepts and commands to such creatures, though they are under no compulsion to obey you. With a successful Insight check (DC determined by the DM), you can read a creature&apos;s body language and vocalizations enough to understand basic messages from it.

Herb Lore:
You have studied the properties of various plants. Even in distant lands your lore serves you well in finding the right leaves and roots to harvest. By brewing a soothing tea or mixing a poultice, you help soothe the aches, bruises, and cuts you and your allies suffer.
   *You and each ally can add 2 to his or her healing surge value when spending heading surges during a short rest. To gain this benefit, you must take the short rest in an area that offers easy access to plants. The additional hit points increase to 4 at 11th level and 6 at 21st level.

Mountain Guide:
You have clambered over steep cliffs and ranged across imposing mountains. Your knack for climbing allows you to pick out the easiest paths up even the most imposing slopes.
   *Whenever you succeed on an Athletics check to climb, you reduce the DC of that climb by 2 for your allies until the end of the encounter. Only allies who see you make the climb gain this benefit.

Watchful Rest:
Long days spent in the wilds have taught you the best way to set up a camp. By picking out an easily defensible spot and carefully positioning your gear, you ensure that you and your allies have the best chance to avoid an ambush.
   *When you take an extended rest, you and any allies also taking the rest do not take the -5 penalty to Perception checks for sleeping.

Wilderness Tracker:
You are an expert at reading the signs of a creature&apos;s passage. When you inspect an area, a splintered twig or a trampled leaf is enough for you to glean a significant amount of information. Even the slyest rogues and sneakiest warlocks leave behind some trace of their passage.
   *During a short rest, you can make a Perception check (DC determined by the DM) to inspect the area around you. This area can be as large as 10 squares on a side. If your check succeeds, you determine the number and nature of the creatures that have moved through the area in the past 24 hours. You ascertain when and where they entered the area, as well as when and where they left.

Warlocks manipulate arcane power, as wizards do, but their conduit to that power is vastly different. For a warlock, it&apos;s as much about who you know as what you know - and in effect, the two are the same.
	All warlocks gain access to their power by entering into a pact with some force or entity in which that power rests. In return for their continuing loyalty and service to the source of their power, warlocks become more adept at their craft, and the abilities they bring to the battlefield grow more lethal.
